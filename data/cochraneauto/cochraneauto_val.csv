CD005996,"We included 16 RCTs (2232 couples analysed). We are uncertain whether glucocorticoids improved live birth rates (odds ratio (OR) 1.37, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 2.71; 2 RCTs, n = 366; I2 = 7%; very low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference between peri-implantation glucocorticoids on multiple pregnancy rates per couple (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.20; 4 RCTs, n = 504; I2 = 53%; very low-certainty evidence). The I2 of 53% may represent moderate statistical heterogeneity and results have to be interpreted with caution. With regard to pregnancy rates, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between ongoing pregnancy rates after glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.19, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.76; 3 RCTs, n = 476; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and clinical pregnancy rates after glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids/placebo (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.44; 13 RCTs, n = 1967; I2 = 0%; low-certainty evidence). This suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids/placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%. Furthermore, we are also uncertain whether peri-implantation glucocorticoids influenced miscarriage rates per couple (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.87; 6 RCTs, n = 821; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence), the incidence of ectopic pregnancies per couple (OR 2.28, 95% CI 0.33 to 15.62; 3 RCTs, n = 320; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) per couple (OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.90; 3 RCTs, n = 370; I2 = 0%; very low-certainty evidence) compared to no glucocorticoids/placebo. The evidence was very low to low certainty: the main limitations were serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of study methods, and serious imprecision. Overall, there was insufficient evidence that administration of peri-implantation glucocorticoids in IVF/ICSI cycles influenced clinical outcomes. These findings were limited to the routine use of glucocorticoids in subfertile women undergoing IVF or ICSI.","We found 16 randomised controlled trials (studies where treatments are decided at random; these usually give the most reliable evidence about treatment effects) comparing glucocorticoids around the time of embryo implantation versus no glucocorticoids or placebo (dummy treatment), in 2232 couples undergoing IVF/ICSI. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference in live birth rates after glucocorticoids. The evidence suggests that if the chance of live birth following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 9%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 6% and 21%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in multiple pregnancy rates (more than one embryo per pregnancy). With regard to ongoing pregnancy and clinical pregnancy rates, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between glucocorticoids versus no glucocorticoids or placebo. The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy following no glucocorticoids or placebo is assumed to be 25%, the chance following glucocorticoids would be between 24% and 32%. We are also uncertain whether there was a difference in adverse events such as ectopic pregnancy, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (pain and swelling of the ovaries and tummy), but these were poorly and inconsistently reported. The evidence was very low to low quality. The main limitations were poor reporting of study methods and the small size of included studies."
CD000343,"We identified 18 trials in which a total of 1456 preterm infants participated. These trials were generally small and methodologically weak. Meta-analyses provided low- to moderate-certainty evidence showing that multi-nutrient fortification of human milk increases in-hospital rate of weight gain (MD 1.76 g/kg/d, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30 to 2.22), body length (MD 0.11 cm/week, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.15), or head circumference (MD 0.06 cm/week, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.08) among preterm infants. Few data on growth and developmental outcomes assessed beyond infancy are available, and these do not show effects of multi-nutrient fortification. The data do not suggest other benefits or harms and provide low-certainty evidence suggesting effects of multi-nutrient fortification on the risk of necrotising enterocolitis in preterm infants (typical RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.63; 13 studies, 1110 infants). Feeding preterm infants with multi-nutrient fortified human breast milk compared with unfortified human breast milk is associated with modest increases in in-hospital growth rates. Evidence is insufficient to show whether multi-nutrient fortification has any effect on long-term growth or neurodevelopment.","We included 18 trials; most were small (involving 1456 infants in total) and had some design weaknesses that might bias their findings. We assessed this evidence for effects on growth as being of ""low or moderate certainty"" because the included trials were small, had methodological weaknesses, and reported findings that were inconsistent with each other. The data we have available do not suggest an effect of feeding fortified breast milk on outcomes when the child is older. Preterm infants who were fed fortified breast milk put on weight and grew in length and head size a little more quickly while they were in-hospital."
CD009898,"We found no studies meeting the criteria for inclusion in this 2021 review update. We could not evaluate the efficacy of ECP in the treatment of cGvHD in children and adolescents after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation since the second review update again found no RCTs. Current recommendations are based on retrospective or observational studies only. Thus, ideally, ECP should be applied in the context of controlled trials only. However, performing RCTs in this population will be challenging due to the limited number of eligible participants, variable disease presentation and the lack of well-defined response criteria. International collaboration, multicentre trials and appropriate funding for such trials will be needed. If treatment decisions based on clinical data are made in favour of ECP, recipients should be carefully monitored for beneficial and harmful effects. In addition, efforts should be made to share this information with other clinicians, for example by setting up registries for children and adolescents treated with ECP.","We did not find any RCTs that analysed the efficacy of ECP for children and adolescents with cGvHD after HSCT. Current recommendations are only based on retrospective studies (where outcomes occurred to the participants before the study began) or observational studies (where investigators did not intervene, and simply observed the course of events). Ideally, ECP should only be given to children and adolescents in the context of RCTs. If children and adolescents are given ECP, doctors should collect information about beneficial and harmful effects and set up registries for people treated with ECP."
CD003617,"Seven trials were identified. Two of them were at low risk of bias (the HALT-C and EPIC3 trials) and included 1676 patients. Both of these trials addressed the role of long-term low-dose pegylated interferon therapy in patients with severe fibrosis (demonstrated on liver biopsy) and were designed to assess the clinical outcomes. The remaining five trials included 300 patients and were at high risk of bias. Based on all trials reporting the outcomes, no significant difference was observed in either all-cause mortality (78/843 (9.3%) versus 62/867 (7.2%); risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.79; 3 trials) or hepatic mortality (41/532 (7.7%) versus 40/552 (7.2%); RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.63; 2 trials); however, when only the two trials at low risk of bias were combined, all-cause mortality was significantly higher in the recipients of the pegylated interferon (78/828 (9.4%) versus 57/848 (6.7%); RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.96) although trial sequential analysis could not exclude the possibility of random error. There was less variceal bleeding in the recipients of the interferon (4/843 (0.5%) versus 18/867 (2.1%); RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67; 3 trials), although again trial sequential analysis could not exclude the presence of a type I error and the effect could not be confirmed in a random-effects model meta-analysis. No significant differences were seen with regard to the development of ascites, encephalopathy, hepatocellular carcinoma, or the need for liver transplantation. One trial reported quality of life data; the pain score was significantly worse in the recipients of the pegylated interferon. Adverse effects tended to be more common in the interferon recipients; the ones that were significantly more common included hematologic complications, infections, flu-like symptoms, and rash. The recipients of interferon had significantly more sustained viral responses (20/557 (3.6%) versus 1/579 (0.2%); RR 15.38, 95% CI 2.93 to 80.71; 4 trials) and a type I error was excluded by trial sequential analysis. The METAVIR activity score also improved (36/55 (65%) versus 20/46 (43.5%); RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.18; 2 trials). No significant differences were seen with regard to histologic fibrosis assessments. The clinical data were limited to patients with histologic evidence of severe fibrosis who were retreated with pegylated interferon. In this scenario, retreatment with interferon did not appear to provide significant clinical benefit and, when only the trials at low risk of bias were considered, retreatment for several years may even have increased all-cause mortality. Such treatment also produced adverse events. On the other hand, the treatment did result in improvement in some surrogate outcomes, namely sustained viral responses and histologic evidence of inflammation. Interferon monotherapy retreatment cannot be recommended for these patients. No clinical data are available for patients with less severe fibrosis. The sustained viral response cannot be used as a surrogate marker for hepatitis C treatment in this clinical setting with low sustained viral response rates and needs to be validated in others in which higher sustained viral response rates are reported.","Seven trials were identified, including two large ones (a total of 1676 patients), known as ""HALT-C"" and ""EPIC3"", that specifically were designed to use low-dose pegylated interferon for three to five years in patients with evidence on liver biopsy of severe fibrosis and who had failed to have a sustained viral response to a course of standard combination (pegylated interferon plus ribavirin) therapy in the past. Both trials were at low risk of bias. A third trial designed to address the use of pegylated interferon monotherapy for 48 weeks in improving survival in patients with cirrhosis (Childs A or B) was terminated early because of the results of the HALT-C and EPIC3 trials, so three trials have provided mortality and hepatic morbidity data. When all three trials were considered, there was no significant effect of the treatment on either all-cause mortality (78/843 (9.3%) versus 62/867 (7.2%); risk ratio (RR) 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.79; 3 trials) or hepatic mortality (41/532 (7.7%) versus 40/552 (7.2%); RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.63; 2 trials); however, all-cause mortality was higher in the recipients of the pegylated interferon (78/828 (9.4%) versus 5 7/848 (6.7%); RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.96) when only the two low risk of bias trials were considered. Variceal bleeding occurred less often in the treated patients (4/843 (0.5%) versus 18/867 (2.1%); RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.67), but there were no differences seen with regard to the subsequent development of other manifestations of end-stage liver disease (that is, encephalopathy, ascites, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver transplantation). One trial reported quality of life data; the treated patients had increases in their pain scores. The recipients of the pegylated interferon generally had more adverse events; statistically significant differences were seen for the occurrence of hematologic complications, infections, flu-like symptoms, and rashes. Those receiving interferon were more likely to have sustained viral responses (20/557 (3.6%) versus 1/579 (0.2%); RR 15.38, 95% CI 2.93 to 80.71) and were also more likely to have improvements in markers of inflammation. No difference was demonstrated regarding the effect of the treatment on markers of fibrosis. The use of longer-term (several years) interferon monotherapy in patients with severe underlying hepatic fibrosis who have failed previous courses of treatment is not supported by the evidence; no trials providing data regarding clinical outcomes were identified in other potential treatment scenarios. Two of the commonly employed surrogate markers, sustained viral response and markers of inflammation, failed to be validated since they improved even though the clinical outcomes did not (or may even have become worse). Patients who fail to have sustained viral responses after an initial course of therapy do become potential candidates for retreatment; some of them may be intolerant to ribavirin, and possibly even the newer protease inhibitors, so retreatment would have to be with interferon alone. This failure to validate the sustained viral response in this group of patients with a low sustained viral response rate suggests that the presumed validity of the use of sustained viral responses in other groups of patients with chronic hepatitis C viral infections who receive treatment must be formally validated."
CD006171,"Two cluster-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (involving a total of 5455 women) met the inclusion criteria. The two included trials measured the effectiveness of the intervention in different ways, which meant that meta-analysis of the results was not possible. The overall quality of the two studies, as assessed using the GRADE approach, was low, with high risk of detection and attrition bias in both included trials. One trial (432 women enrolled) conducted in Canada was judged of low methodological quality. This trial did not report on any of the review's pre-specified primary outcomes and the secondary outcomes reported results only as P values. Moreover, losses to follow-up were high (34%, 147 out of 432 women initially enrolled). The authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. The second trial conducted in France was also judged of low methodological quality. Losses to follow-up were also high (44.5%, 2233 out of 5023 women initially enrolled) and differential (40% in the intervention group and 52% in the control group). The authors concluded that prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmoses has a significant effect on improving women's knowledge, whereas it has no effect on changing women's behavior. In this trial 17/3949 pregnant women seroconverted for toxoplasmosis: 13/2591 (0.5%) in the intervention group and 4/1358 (0.3%) in the control group. The rate of seroconversion detected during the study did not differ between groups (risk ratio (RR) 1.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.56 to 5.21; participants = 3949; studies = one, low quality evidence). The number of events was too small to reach conclusions about the effect of prenatal education on seroconversion rate during pregnancy. No other randomized trials on the effect of prenatal education on congenital toxoplasmosis rate, or toxoplasmosis seroconversion rate during pregnancy were detected. Even though primary prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis is considered a desirable intervention, given the lack of related risks compared to secondary and tertiary prevention, its effectiveness has not been adequately evaluated. There is very little evidence from RCTs that prenatal education is effective in reducing congenital toxoplasmosis even though evidence from observational studies suggests it is. Given the lack of good evidence supporting prenatal education for congenital toxoplasmosis prevention, further RCTs are needed to confirm any potential benefits and to further quantify the impact of different sets of educational intervention.","This review included two randomized controlled trials (involving 5455 women). Data could not be combined because each trial measured effectiveness in different ways. One study was from Canada and involved 432 women randomly assigned to a 10-minute presentation during a prenatal class about toxoplasmosis prevention or to a usual prenatal class. Losses to follow-up were high and 285 completed the post-test questionnaire in the third trimester. However, the authors concluded that prenatal education can effectively change pregnant women's behavior as it increased pet, personal and food hygiene. Both trials were judged as having low methodological quality as assessed by the GRADE approach. Losses to follow-up were high and 2790 completed both pre-test and post-test questionnaire on behavior (44.5% loss to follow-up), whereas 3949 women were tested for blood antibodies (22.4% loss to follow-up). Similarly, the seroconversion rate did not differ between groups (13 out of 2591 women seroconverted in the intervention and four out of 1358 in the control group). Evidence supporting prenatal education to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis is therefore limited."
CD006259,"We identified 11 trials that enrolled 687 eyes of 679 participants. The studies were conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. We considered one study to be at low risk of bias in all domains, six studies to be at high risk of bias in one or more domains, and the remaining four studies to be at an unclear risk of bias in all domains. The risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was less in those participants who received MMC compared to those who received 5-FU, however the confidence intervals were wide and are compatible with no effect (risk ratio (RR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.30 to 1.00; studies = 11; I2 = 40%). There was no evidence for any difference between groups at high and low risk of failure (test for subgroup differences P = 0.69). On average, people treated with MMC had lower intraocular pressure at one year (mean difference (MD) -3.05 mmHg, 95% CI -4.60 to -1.50), but the studies were inconsistent (I2 = 52%). The size of the effect was greater in the high-risk group (MD -4.18 mmHg, 95% CI -6.73 to -1.64) compared to the low-risk group (MD -1.72 mmHg, 95% CI -3.28 to -0.16), but again the test for interaction was not statistically significant (P = 0.11). Similar proportions of eyes treated with MMC lost 2 or more lines of visual acuity one year after surgery compared to 5-FU, but the confidence intervals were wide (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.54 to 2.06). Adverse events occurred relatively rarely, and estimates of effect were generally imprecise. There was some evidence for less epitheliopathy in the MMC group (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.47) and less hyphaema in the MMC group (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.91). None of the studies reported quality of life. Overall, we graded the quality of the evidence as low largely because of risk of bias in the included studies and imprecision in the estimate of effect. We found low-quality evidence that MMC may be more effective in achieving long-term lower intraocular pressure than 5-FU. Further comparative research on MMC and 5-FU is needed to enhance reliability and validity of the results shown in this review. Furthermore, the development of new agents that control postoperative scar tissue formation without side effects would be valuable and is justified by the results of this review.","In total, 687 eyes of 679 participants underwent routine trabeculectomy for glaucoma control. We included 11 randomised controlled trials conducted in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa in this review. Five studies enrolled participants at low risk of trabeculectomy failure, five studies enrolled participants at high risk of failure, and one study enrolled people with both high and low risk of failure. None of the included trials enrolled participants with combined trabeculectomy/cataract surgery. Our review showed that the risk of failure of trabeculectomy at one year after surgery was slightly less in those participants treated with MMC compared to 5-FU. We did not detect any significant differences between the subgroups of participants at low and high risk of failure, but the power of this analysis was low. None of the studies reported quality of life. We graded the quality of the evidence as low, mostly due to the risk of bias in the included studies. We identified no difference between the visual outcomes of the group that received MMC and the group that received 5-FU at one year postoperatively nor in the number of drops used postoperatively. However, we found evidence to suggest that MMC was more effective at lowering intraocular pressure than 5-FU in both high- and low-risk participants, achieving a lower mean intraocular pressure postoperatively than in those who were treated with 5-FU at one year."
CD007851,"We included three trials (283 participants in the analyses) that ran for two to three years. All participants were ex- or never-smokers and had genetic variants that carried a high risk of developing COPD. Only one trial reported mortality data (one person of 93 died in the treatment group and three of 87 died in the placebo group). There was no information on harms in the oldest trial. Another trial reported serious adverse events in 10 participants in the treatment group and 18 participants in the placebo group. In the most recent trial, serious adverse events occurred in 28 participants in each group. None of the trials reported mean number of lung infections or hospital admissions. In the two trials that reported exacerbations, there were more exacerbations in the treatment group than in the placebo group, but the results of both trials included the possibility of no difference. Quality of life was similar in the two groups. Forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) deteriorated more in participants in the treatment group than in the placebo group but the confidence interval (CI) included no difference (standardised mean difference -0.19, 95% CI -0.42 to 0.05; P = 0.12). For carbon monoxide diffusion, the difference was -0.11 mmol/minute/kPa (95% CI -0.35 to 0.12; P = 0.34). Lung density measured by computer tomography (CT) scan deteriorated significantly less in the treatment group than in the placebo group (mean difference (MD) 0.86 g/L, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.42; P = 0.002). Several secondary outcomes were unreported in the largest and most recent trial whose authors had numerous financial conflicts of interest. This review update added one new study and 143 new participants, but the conclusions remain unchanged. Due to sparse data, we could not arrive at a conclusion about the impact of augmentation therapy on mortality, exacerbations, lung infections, hospital admission and quality of life, and there was uncertainty about possible harms. Therefore, it is our opinion that augmentation therapy with alpha-1 antitrypsin cannot be recommended.","We found three randomised clinical trials (283 participants in the analyses) comparing treatment with alpha-1 antitrypsin with placebo (a pretend treatment) for two to three years. All participants were ex-smokers or had never smoked but had the genetic problem that carried a high risk of developing lung problems. Only one trial reported deaths (one of 93 participants died taking the medicine and three of 87 died taking placebo). There was no information on harms in the oldest trial. In another trial, serious adverse events occurred in 10 participants in the medicine group and 18 participants in the placebo group. In the most recent trial, serious adverse events occurred in 28 participants in each group. None of the trials reported on the number of lung infections or hospital admissions. There were more exacerbations (acute worsening in lung function) in the medicine group than in the placebo group, whereas quality of life was similar in the two groups. Lung function deteriorated significantly less when measured by a special type of X-ray called a computer tomography (CT) scan. Several secondary outcomes were unreported in the largest and most recent trial whose authors had numerous financial conflicts of interest. Therefore, it is our opinion that treatment with alpha-1 antitrypsin augmentation cannot be recommended."
CD010268,"We included 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants, in this review. Eleven trials performed a total of 16 head-to-head comparisons of different prophylactic antibiotic regimens. Antibiotic prophylaxis was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in one trial. All the trials were at high risk of bias. With the exception of one trial in which all the participants were positive for nasal carriage of MRSA or had had previous MRSA infections, it does not appear that MRSA was tested or eradicated prior to surgery; nor does it appear that there was high prevalence of MRSA carrier status in the people undergoing surgery. There was no sufficient clinical similarity between the trials to perform a meta-analysis. The overall all-cause mortality in four trials that reported mortality was 14/1401 (1.0%) and there were no significant differences in mortality between the intervention and control groups in each of the individual comparisons. There were no antibiotic-related serious adverse events in any of the 561 people randomised to the seven different antibiotic regimens in four trials (three trials that reported mortality and one other trial). None of the trials reported quality of life, total length of hospital stay or the use of healthcare resources. Overall, 221/4032 (5.5%) people developed SSIs due to all organisms, and 46/4704 (1.0%) people developed SSIs due to MRSA. In the 15 comparisons that compared one antibiotic regimen with another, there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed SSIs. In the single trial that compared an antibiotic regimen with placebo, the proportion of people who developed SSIs was significantly lower in the group that received antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav (or cefotaxime if allergic to penicillin) compared with placebo (all SSI: RR 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.65; MRSA SSI RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.83). In two trials that reported MRSA infections other than SSI, 19/478 (4.5%) people developed MRSA infections including SSI, chest infection and bacteraemia. There were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed MRSA infections at any body site in these two comparisons. Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with placebo in people without malignant disease undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy insertion, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence to suggest that using a combination of multiple prophylactic antibiotics or administering prophylactic antibiotics for an increased duration is of benefit to people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections. Well designed RCTs assessing the clinical effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens are necessary on this topic.","We identified 12 RCTs, with 4704 participants. Eleven trials compared 16 preventative (prophylactic) antibiotic treatments, and one compared antibiotic prophylaxis with no prophylaxis. Four studies reported deaths (14/1401 participants): approximately 1% of participants died from any cause after surgery, but there were no significant differences between treatment groups. Four trials reported on serious antibiotic-related adverse events - there were none in 561 participants. None of the trials reported quality of life, length of hospital stay or use of healthcare resources. Overall, 221 SSIs due to any bacterium developed in 4032 people (6%), and 46 MRSA SSIs developed in 4704 people (1%). There were no significant differences in development of SSIs between the 15 comparisons of one antibiotic treatment against another. When antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav was compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis, a significantly lower proportion of people developed SSIs after receiving co-amoxiclav (74% reduction in all SSIs, and 95% reduction in MRSA SSIs). Two trials reported that 19 participants developed MRSA infection in wounds (SSIs), chest, or bloodstream, but there were no significant differences in the proportion of people who developed them between the two comparisons. Prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav decreases the proportion of people developing MRSA infections compared with no antibiotic prophylaxis in people without cancer undergoing surgery for feeding tube insertion into the stomach using endoscopy, although this may be due to decreasing overall infection thereby preventing wounds from becoming secondarily infected with MRSA. There is currently no other evidence that either a combination of prophylactic antibiotics, or increased duration of antibiotic treatment, benefits people undergoing surgery in terms of reducing MRSA infections. Well-designed RCTs are necessary to assess different antibiotic treatments for preventing MRSA infections after surgery."
CD008776,"We identified 16 randomised controlled trials with 3578 participants that fitted our inclusion criteria. These studies included a wide spectrum of interventions covering clinic-based brief interventions, Internet-based interventions that could be used from home and mobile phone-based interventions. The mean age of participants was between 46 to 67 years old and mean time since diagnosis was 6 to 13 years. The duration of the interventions varied between 1 to 12 months. There were three reported deaths out of 3578 participants. Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions currently have limited effectiveness. They appear to have small benefits on glycaemic control (pooled effect on glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c): -2.3 mmol/mol or -0.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.4 to -0.1; P = 0.009; 2637 participants; 11 trials). The effect size on HbA1c was larger in the mobile phone subgroup (subgroup analysis: mean difference in HbA1c -5.5 mmol/mol or -0.5% (95% CI -0.7 to -0.3); P < 0.00001; 280 participants; three trials). Current interventions do not show adequate evidence for improving depression, health-related quality of life or weight. Four (out of 10) interventions showed beneficial effects on lipid profile. One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no other documented adverse effects. Two studies provided limited cost-effectiveness data - with one study suggesting costs per patient of less than $140 (in 1997) or 105 EURO and another study showed no change in health behaviour and resource utilisation. Computer-based diabetes self-management interventions to manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small beneficial effect on blood glucose control and the effect was larger in the mobile phone subgroup. There is no evidence to show benefits in other biological outcomes or any cognitive, behavioural or emotional outcomes.","We identified 16 trials involving 3578 adults that met our criteria. These studies included different types of interventions used in different places like touch screen computers in hospital clinics, computers connected to the Internet at home and programmes that communicated with mobile phones. The average age of people taking part was between 46 to 67 years old and most of those people had lived with diabetes for 6 to 13 years. Participants were given access to the interventions for 1 to 12 months, depending on the intervention. Three out of the 3578 participants died but these deaths did not appear to be linked to the trials. Overall, there is evidence that computer programmes have a small beneficial effect on blood sugar control - the estimated improvement in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c - a long-term measurement of metabolic control) was 2.3 mmol/mol or 0.2%. One participant withdrew because of anxiety but there were no obvious side effects and hypoglycaemic episodes were not reported in any of the studies. In summary, existing computer programmes to help adults self-manage type 2 diabetes appear to have a small positive effect on blood sugar control and the mobile phone interventions appeared to have larger effects. There is no evidence to show that current programmes can help with weight loss, depression or improving health-related quality of life but they do appear to be safe."
CD008554,"Three randomised, placebo-controlled trials with a total of 50 participants were included in the review. All three trials compared rTMS with sham TMS. All the trials were of poor methodological quality and were insufficiently homogeneous to allow the pooling of results. Moreover, the high rate of attrition further increased the risk of bias. None of the trials provided detailed data on the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R) scores at six months follow-up which was pre-assigned as our primary outcome. One trial contained data in a suitable form for quantitative analysis of our secondary outcomes. No difference was seen between rTMS and sham rTMS using the ALSFRS-R scores and manual muscle testing (MMT) scores at 12 months follow-up in this trial. Additionally, none of the trials reported any adverse events associated with the use of rTMS. However, in view of the small sample size, the methodological limitations and incomplete outcome data, treatment with rTMS cannot be judged as completely safe. There is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the efficacy and safety of rTMS in the treatment of ALS. Further studies may be helpful if their potential benefit is weighed against the impact of participation in a randomised controlled trial on people with ALS.","For this review we searched widely for clinical trials of rTMS in people with ALS and found three studies, which involved 50 participants in total. All three compared rTMS with sham (inactive) rTMS. None of the three studies reported on disability or limitation in activity as assessed by a specific ALS scale (ALSFRS-R) at six months follow-up, which was what we chose as our primary measure of the effectiveness of rTMS. Other outcome measures were only available from 12 participants in one poor quality trial, in which there was no difference between rTMS and sham rTMS in ALSFRS-R or a test of muscle strength at 12 months’ follow-up. None of the studies reported any adverse effects with rTMS. The trials in this review had small numbers of participants and some problems of design, so larger, well-designed trials should be considered, to determine the efficacy and safety of rTMS in ALS. However, the potential benefit should be balanced against the impact of taking part in trials for people with ALS."
CD012638,"Eleven studies satisfied inclusion criteria, lasting one week or longer; 949 participants with mostly moderate or severe pain were randomised initially, but fewer completed treatment or had results of treatment. Eight studies were double-blind, two single-blind, and one open-label. None had a placebo only control; eight compared different NSAIDs, three an NSAID with opioid or opioid combination, and one both. None compared an NSAID plus opioid with the same dose of opioid alone. Most studies were at high risk of bias for blinding, incomplete outcome data, or small size; none was unequivocally at low risk of bias. It was not possible to compare NSAIDs as a group with another treatment, or one NSAID with another NSAID. Results for all NSAIDs are reported as a randomised cohort. We judged results for all outcomes as very low-quality evidence. None of the studies reported our primary outcomes of participants with pain reduction of at least 50%, and at least 30%, from baseline; participants with Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) of much improved or very much improved (or equivalent wording). With NSAID, initially moderate or severe pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in four studies (415 participants in total), with a range of estimates between 26% and 51% in individual studies. Adverse event and withdrawal reporting was inconsistent. Two serious adverse events were reported with NSAIDs, and 22 deaths, but these were not clearly related to any pain treatment. Common adverse events were thirst/dry mouth (15%), loss of appetite (14%), somnolence (11%), and dyspepsia (11%). Withdrawals were common, mostly because of lack of efficacy (24%) or adverse events (5%). There is no high-quality evidence to support or refute the use of NSAIDs alone or in combination with opioids for the three steps of the three-step WHO cancer pain ladder. There is very low-quality evidence that some people with moderate or severe cancer pain can obtain substantial levels of benefit within one or two weeks.","In April 2017, we found 11 studies with 949 participants. They compared NSAID with NSAID, or NSAID with opioid drug (morphine or codeine). No studies looked at using NSAID together with an opioid-like morphine, which is how they are often used. Many different NSAIDs were tested, and it was not possible to make sensible comparisons. The quality of the evidence was very low. Very low-quality evidence means that we are very uncertain about the impact of an NSAID alone for treating cancer pain. With an NSAID, initially moderate or severe cancer pain was reduced to no worse than mild pain after one or two weeks in 1 in 4 (26%) to 1 in 2 (51%) people in four studies. Side-effect reporting was poor. Two serious side effects were reported with NSAIDs, and 22 deaths, but these were not related to pain treatment. Common side effects were thirst/dry mouth (1 in 7; 15%), loss of appetite (1 in 7; 14%), sleepiness (1 in 10; 11%), and heartburn (1 in 10; 11%)."
CD003717,"We included 16 studies involving data from 1884 participants. Nine studies included participants considering real clinical trials, and eight included participants considering hypothetical clinical trials, with one including both. All studies were conducted in high-income countries. There is still much uncertainty about the effect of audio-visual informed consent interventions on a range of patient outcomes. However, when considered across comparisons, we found low to very low quality evidence that such interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate. Audio-visual presentation of informed consent may improve participant satisfaction with the consent information provided. However its effect on satisfaction with other aspects of the process is not clear. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent. We found conflicting, very low quality evidence about whether audio-visual interventions took more or less time to administer. No study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use. The evidence from real clinical trials was rated as low quality for most outcomes, and for hypothetical studies, very low. We note, however, that this was in large part due to poor study reporting, the hypothetical nature of some studies and low participant numbers, rather than inconsistent results between studies or confirmed poor trial quality. We do not believe that any studies were funded by organisations with a vested interest in the results. The value of audio-visual interventions as a tool for helping to enhance the informed consent process for people considering participating in clinical trials remains largely unclear, although trends are emerging with regard to improvements in knowledge and satisfaction. Many relevant outcomes have not been evaluated in randomised trials. Triallists should continue to explore innovative methods of providing information to potential trial participants during the informed consent process, mindful of the range of outcomes that the intervention should be designed to achieve, and balancing the resource implications of intervention development and delivery against the purported benefits of any intervention. More trials, adhering to CONSORT standards, and conducted in settings and populations underserved in this review, i.e. low- and middle-income countries and people with low literacy, would strengthen the results of this review and broaden its applicability. Assessing process measures, such as time taken to administer the intervention and researcher satisfaction, would inform the implementation of audio-visual consent materials.","We found 16 studies, involving a total of 1884 people. Nine studies included people considering real clinical trials, eight included people asked to imagine participating in a clinical trial (a hypothetical trial), with one including both. Most of the studies were conducted in the United States. We searched for studies of audio-visual informed consent interventions which allocated people to an experimental or control group by a random or quasi-random process, published up until June 2012. There is low to very low quality evidence that audio-visual consent interventions may slightly improve knowledge or understanding of the parent trial, but may make little or no difference to rate of participation or willingness to participate. Audio-visual presentation may improve participation satisfaction with the information provided. However its effect on satisfaction with other aspects of the process is not clear. There is not enough evidence to draw conclusions about anxiety arising from audio-visual informed consent. There is conflicting, very low quality evidence about whether audio-visual interventions take more or less time to administer, and no study measured researcher satisfaction with the informed consent process, nor ease of use. The quality of evidence from real clinical trials was low, and from hypothetical clinical studies, very low. We do not believe that any studies were funded by organisations with a vested interest in the results."
CD003067,"We included 11 trials with 3374 participants aged five to 10 years when trials started. Three trials are new since the 2016 update. Two trials did not contribute data to our analysis. Sealant versus fluoride varnish
Resin-based fissure sealants versus fluoride varnishes
Seven trials evaluated this comparison (five contributing data). We are uncertain if resin-based sealants may be better than fluoride varnish, or vice versa, for preventing caries in first permanent molars at two to three years' follow-up (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.19; I2 = 84%; 4 studies, 1683 children evaluated). One study measuring decayed, missing and filled permanent surfaces (DMFS) and decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth (DMFT) increment at two years suggested a small benefit for fissure sealant (DMFS MD –0.09, 95% CI –0.15 to –0.03; DMFT MD –0.08, 95% CI –0.14 to –0.02; 542 participants), though this may not be clinically significant. One small study, at high risk of bias, reported a benefit for sealant after four years in preventing caries (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.84; 75 children) and at nine years (RR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.79; 75 children). We assessed each of these results as having very low certainty. Glass ionomer-based sealants versus fluoride varnishes
Three trials evaluated this comparison: one trial with chemically cured glass ionomer and two with resin-modified glass ionomer. Studies were clinically diverse, so we did not conduct a meta-analysis. In general, the studies found no benefit of one intervention over another at one, two and three years, although one study, which also included oral health education, suggested a benefit from sealants over varnish for children at high risk of caries. We assessed this evidence as very low certainty. Sealant plus fluoride varnish versus fluoride varnish alone
One split-mouth trial analysing 92 children at two-year follow-up found in favour of resin-based fissure sealant plus fluoride varnish over fluoride varnish only (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.55), which represented a clinically meaningful effect of a 77% reduction in caries after two years; however, we assessed this evidence as very low certainty. Adverse events
Five trials (1801 participants) (four using resin-based sealant material and one using resin-modified glass ionomer) reported that no adverse events resulted from use of sealants or fluoride varnishes over one to nine years. The other studies did not mention adverse events. Applying fluoride varnish or resin-based fissure sealants to first permanent molars helps prevent occlusal caries, but it has not been possible in this review to reach reliable conclusions about which one is better to apply. The available studies do not suggest either intervention is superior, but we assessed this evidence as having very low certainty. We found very low-certainty evidence that placing resin-based sealant as well as applying fluoride varnish works better than applying fluoride varnish alone. Fourteen studies are currently ongoing and their findings may allow us to draw firmer conclusions about whether sealants and varnish work equally well or whether one is better than the other.","We found 11 studies that included 3374 children aged between five and 10 years at the start of the studies. One small study found that using both sealants and fluoride varnish may work better than using fluoride varnish alone. Based on our assessments, we categorised the evidence as being of very low, low, moderate or high certainty. The three individual studies that compared sealants made from glass ionomer versus fluoride varnish could not be combined and had mixed results. We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups), because these studies provide the most robust evidence about the effects of a treatment. We assessed how certain the evidence was. The other studies did not mention whether or not any side effects occurred. At present, we do not know whether it is better to apply sealants or fluoride varnish to prevent tooth decay in children's back teeth. We do know that both interventions are effective for reducing tooth decay, and current evidence does not suggest that one works better than the other. Fourteen studies are currently underway."
CD001150,"We included 22 trials with a total of 5578 infant participants. The main potential sources of bias were lack of clarity on the methods used to generate random sequences and conceal allocation in half of the trials, and lack of masking of parents, caregivers, clinicians, and investigators in all of the trials. Eight trials (2086 infants) examined the effect of topical ointments or creams. Most participants were very preterm infants cared for in healthcare facilities in high-income countries. Meta-analyses suggested that topical ointments or creams may have little or no effect on invasive infection (RR 1.13, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97 to 1.31; low certainty evidence) or mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08; low certainty evidence). Fifteen trials (3492 infants) assessed the effect of topical plant or vegetable oils. Most of these trials were undertaken in low- or middle-income countries and were based in healthcare facilities. One large (2249 infants) community-based trial occurred in a rural field practice in India. Meta-analyses suggested that topical oils may reduce invasive infection (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96; I² = 52%; low certainty evidence) but have little or no effect on mortality (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.08, I² = 3%; low certainty evidence). One trial (316 infants) that compared petroleum-based ointment versus sunflower seed oil in very preterm infants in Bangladesh showed little or no effect on invasive infection (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.46; low certainty evidence), but suggested that ointment may lower mortality slightly (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98; RD -0.12, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.01; number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome 8, 95% CI 4 to 100; low certainty evidence). One trial (64 infants) that assessed the effect of coconut oil versus mineral oil in preterm infants with birth weight 1500 g to 2000 g in India reported no episodes of invasive infection or death in either group (very low certainty evidence). The level of certainty about the effects of emollient therapy on invasive infection or death in preterm infants is low. Since these interventions are mostly inexpensive, readily accessible, and generally acceptable, further good-quality randomised controlled trials in healthcare facilities, and in community settings in low- or middle-income countries, may be justified.","In total, 5578 infants participated. Eight trials (2086 infants) examined the effect of topical ointments or creams in very preterm infants (born more than eight weeks early) cared for in hospitals, mostly in high-income countries. Fourteen trials (3492 infants) assessed the effect of sunflower and other vegetable oils, mostly in low- or middle-income countries in south Asia. All but one of these trials was conducted in hospitals. One large trial in India (2249 infants) was based in the community. Application of sunflower and other vegetable oils may reduce invasive infection but have little or no effect on mortality. These analyses provide low certainty evidence about the effects of emollient therapy on serious infection or death in preterm infants. Since these interventions are mostly inexpensive, readily accessible, and generally acceptable, further good-quality randomised controlled trials in healthcare facilities, and in community-settings in low- or middle-income countries, may be justified."
CD003884,"This review includes 11 published studies (172 participants); only one examined long-term oxygen therapy (28 participants). There was no statistically significant improvement in survival, lung, or cardiac health. There was an improvement in regular attendance at school or work in those receiving oxygen therapy at 6 and 12 months. Four studies examined the effect of oxygen supplementation during sleep by polysomnography. Although oxygenation improved, mild hypercapnia was noted. Participants fell asleep quicker and spent a reduced percentage of total sleep time in rapid eye movement sleep, but there were no demonstrable improvements in qualitative sleep parameters. Six studies evaluated oxygen supplementation during exercise. Again, oxygenation improved, but mild hypercapnia resulted. Participants receiving oxygen therapy were able to exercise for a significantly longer duration during exercise. Other exercise parameters were not altered by the use of oxygen. There are no published data to guide the prescription of chronic oxygen supplementation to people with advanced lung disease due to CF. Short-term oxygen therapy during sleep and exercise improves oxygenation but is associated with modest and probably clinically inconsequential hypercapnia. There are improvements in exercise duration, time to fall asleep and regular attendance at school or work. There is a need for larger, well-designed clinical trials to assess the benefits of long-term oxygen therapy in people with CF administered continuously or during exercise or sleep or both. However, we do not expect any new research to be undertaken in this area any time soon and do not plan to update this review again until any new evidence does become available.","We found eleven studies with 172 participants to include in the review. Four of the studies looked at giving additional oxygen at night. Participants breathing oxygen at night also spent less time in REM sleep and took less time to fall asleep. Six of the studies looked at the effect of extra oxygen on exercise. The levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood of participants increased during or after exercise when they breathed in low-flow oxygen. People were able to exercise for longer if they breathed in low-flow oxygen. In the short term, treatment has shown some improvement in blood oxygen levels in people with CF during sleep and exercise. There was more regular attendance at school or work in those receiving long-term oxygen. There is little evidence to support or oppose the long-term use of oxygen therapy in people with advanced CF lung disease. There should be research into the effects of long-term oxygen treatment on sleep quality and exercise in people with CF. Unfortunately, we do not expect that any such research will be undertaken any time soon, so we do not plan to update this review again until we find any new trials."
CD005122,"We included no new trials in this update. We included four trials involving more than 13,000 women which were conducted in the UK and Ireland and included women in labour. Three trials were funded by the hospitals where the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. No declarations of interest were made in two trials; the remaining two trials did not mention declarations of interest. Overall, the studies were assessed as low risk of bias. Results reported in the 2012 review remain unchanged. Although not statistically significant using a strict P < 0.05 criterion, data were consistent with women allocated to admission CTG having, on average, a higher probability of an increase in incidence of caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (risk ratio (RR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.44, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the average treatment effect across included trials between women allocated to admission CTG and women allocated to intermittent auscultation in instrumental vaginal birth (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.27, 4 trials, 11,338 women, I² = 38%, low quality evidence) and perinatal mortality rate (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.30 to 3.47, 4 trials, 11,339 infants, I² = 0%, moderate quality evidence). Women allocated to admission CTG had, on average, higher rates of continuous electronic fetal monitoring during labour (RR 1.30, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.48, 3 trials, 10,753 women, I² = 79%, low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.13 to 1.45, 3 trials, 10,757 women, I² = 0%) than women allocated to intermittent auscultation. There were no differences between groups in other secondary outcome measures including incidence and severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (incidence only reported) (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.37 to 3.90; 2367 infants; 1 trial; very low quality evidence) and incidence of seizures in the neonatal period (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.61; 8056 infants; 1 trial; low quality evidence). There were no data reported for severe neurodevelopmental disability assessed at greater than, or equal to, 12 months of age. Contrary to continued use in some clinical areas, we found no evidence of benefit for the use of the admission CTG for low-risk women on admission in labour. Furthermore, the probability is that admission CTG increases the caesarean section rate by approximately 20%. The data lacked power to detect possible important differences in perinatal mortality. However, it is unlikely that any trial, or meta-analysis, will be adequately powered to detect such differences. The findings of this review support recommendations that the admission CTG not be used for women who are low risk on admission in labour. Women should be informed that admission CTG is likely associated with an increase in the incidence of caesarean section without evidence of benefit. Evidence quality ranged from moderate to very low, with downgrading decisions based on imprecision, inconsistency and a lack of blinding for participants and personnel. All four included trials were conducted in developed Western European countries. One additional study is ongoing. The usefulness of the findings of this review for developing countries will depend on FHR monitoring practices. However, an absence of benefit and likely harm associated with admission CTG will have relevance for countries where questions are being asked about the role of the admission CTG. Future studies evaluating the effects of the admission CTG should consider including women admitted with signs of labour and before a formal diagnosis of labour. This would include a cohort of women currently having admission CTGs and not included in current trials.","We searched for evidence to 30 November 2016 but found no new studies for this updated review (previously published in 2012). The included studies (carried out in the UK and Ireland) involved more than 13,000 women with low-risk pregnancies. Three trials were funded by the hospitals were the trials took place and one trial was funded by the Scottish government. Women allocated to admission CTG were probably more likely to have a caesarean section than women allocated to intermittent auscultation (moderate quality evidence). There was no difference in the number of instrumental vaginal births (low quality evidence) or in numbers of babies who died during or shortly after labour (moderate quality evidence) between women in the two groups. Admission CTG was associated with an increase in the use of continuous EFM (with an electrode placed on the baby’s scalp) (low quality evidence) and fetal blood sampling (a small blood sample taken from a baby's scalp) during labour. There were no differences in other outcomes measured such as artificial rupture of the membranes, augmentation of labour, use of an epidural, damage to the baby's brain due to lack of oxygen (very low quality evidence), or the baby having fits or seizures just after birth (low quality evidence). No studies reported if the babies developed any severe problems in brain or central nervous system growth and development after one year of age. Although many hospitals carry out CTGs on women when they are admitted to hospital in labour, we found no evidence that this benefits women with low-risk pregnancies. We found that admission CTGs may increase numbers of women having a caesarean section by about 20%. Based on this review, low-risk pregnant women who have an admission CTG could be more likely to have a caesarean section. However, countries that use admission CTGs should start to question why, because there are not clear benefits to using admission CTGs, and they could be causing women harm by making them more likely to have a caesarean section. All of the included studies took place in developed Western European countries. The review findings might not be useful to people in very different countries or where different ways of FHR monitoring are used."
CD007876,"We included 32 studies in this review. Seventeen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles (total 1018) and twelve randomised oocytes (over 15,230). It was not possible to pool any of the data because each study compared different culture media. Only seven studies reported live birth or ongoing pregnancy. Four of these studies found no evidence of a difference between the media compared, for either day three or day five embryo transfer. The data from the fifth study did not appear reliable. Six studies reported clinical pregnancy rate. One of these found a difference between the media compared, suggesting that for cleavage-stage embryo transfer, Quinn's Advantage was associated with higher clinical pregnancy rates than G5 (odds ratio (OR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 2.16; 692 women). This study was available only as an abstract and the quality of the evidence was low. With regards to adverse effects, three studies reported multiple pregnancies and six studies reported miscarriage. None of them found any evidence of a difference between the culture media used. None of the studies reported on the health of offspring. Most studies (22/32) failed to report their source of funding and none described their methodology in adequate detail. The overall quality of the evidence was rated as very low for nearly all comparisons, the main limitations being imprecision and poor reporting of study methods. An optimal embryo culture medium is important for embryonic development and subsequently the success of IVF or ICSI treatment. There has been much controversy about the most appropriate embryo culture medium. Numerous studies have been performed, but no two studies compared the same culture media and none of them found any evidence of a difference between the culture media used. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of any specific culture medium. Properly designed and executed randomised trials are necessary.","We included 32 randomised controlled trials of a wide variety of different commercially available culture media in women undergoing IVF or ICSI. Sixteen studies randomised women (total 3666), three randomised cycles (total 1018) and twelve randomised oocytes (over 15,230). No two studies compared the same culture media. Only seven studies reported our primary outcome of live birth or ongoing pregnancy, and they found no good evidence of a difference between the media compared. A single study found low-quality evidence that for day three embryo transfer, Quinn's Advantage may be associated with higher rates than G5, but this study was available only as an abstract and the methods used were not clearly reported. With regard to adverse effects, three studies reported multiple pregnancies and six studies reported miscarriage. None of them found any evidence of a difference between the culture media used.

CD009218,"We included 25 studies involving 10,996 women. Study methods were not well described in many of the included studies and thus assessing risk of bias was difficult. The main limitations of the studies were lack of blinding and high attrition. Studies were mainly funded by international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within the countries. Approximately one third of the included studies did not provide a funding source. Although quality across studies was variable, the results consistently showed that intermittent iron supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) compared with no intervention or a placebo, reduced the risk of having anaemia (risk ratio (RR) 0.65, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49 to 0.87; 11 studies, 3135 participants; low-quality evidence), and improved the concentration of haemoglobin (mean difference (MD) 5.19 g/L, 95% CI 3.07 to 7.32; 15 studies, 2886 participants; moderate-quality evidence), and ferritin (MD 7.46 μg/L, 95% CI 5.02 to 9.90; 7 studies, 1067 participants; low-quality evidence). Intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.04; 3 studies, 624 participants; low-quality evidence), but evidence was inconclusive regarding iron deficiency anaemia (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.16; 1 study, 97 participants; very low-quality evidence) and all-cause morbidity (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.52; 1 study, 119 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women in the control group were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving intermittent iron supplements (RR 1.98, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.72; 3 studies, 630 participants; moderate-quality evidence). In comparison with daily supplementation, results showed that intermittent supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) produced similar effects to daily supplementation (alone or with any other vitamins and minerals) on anaemia (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29; 8 studies, 1749 participants; moderate-quality evidence). Intermittent supplementation may produce similar haemoglobin concentrations (MD 0.43 g/L, 95% CI −1.44 to 2.31; 10 studies, 2127 participants; low-quality evidence) but lower ferritin concentrations on average (MD −6.07 μg/L, 95% CI −10.66 to −1.48; 4 studies, 988 participants; low-quality evidence) compared to daily supplementation. Compared to daily regimens, intermittent regimens may also reduce the risk of having iron deficiency (RR 4.30, 95% CI 0.56 to 33.20; 1 study, 198 participants; very low-quality evidence). Women receiving iron supplements intermittently were less likely to have any adverse side effects than those receiving iron supplements daily (RR 0.41, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.82; 6 studies, 1166 participants; moderate-quality evidence). No studies reported on the effect of intermittent regimens versus daily regimens on iron deficiency anaemia and all-cause morbidity. Information on disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance was scarce, and evidence about the effects of intermittent supplementation on these outcomes unclear. Overall, whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline did not seem to affect the findings. Furthermore, the response did not differ in areas where malaria was frequent, although very few trials were conducted in these settings. Intermittent iron supplementation may reduce anaemia and may improve iron stores among menstruating women in populations with different anaemia and malaria backgrounds. In comparison with daily supplementation, the provision of iron supplements intermittently is probably as effective in preventing or controlling anaemia. More information is needed on morbidity (including malaria outcomes), side effects, work performance, economic productivity, depression, and adherence to the intervention. The quality of this evidence base ranged from very low to moderate quality, suggesting that we are uncertain about these effects.","We included 25 randomised controlled trials (a type of experiment in which participants are randomly assigned to one or more treatment groups) involving 10,996 women. We included studies examining the administration of intermittent iron supplements versus no intervention, a placebo (dummy pill) or the same supplements given on a daily basis. Most studies were implemented in school settings and were mainly funded by international organisations, universities, and ministries of health within the countries. Approximately one-third of the included studies did not provide a funding source. The findings show that women receiving intermittent supplementation with iron alone, or in combination with folic acid or other nutrients, were less likely to be anaemic or iron deficient than those women who received no iron supplements or a placebo. In addition, the findings indicate that intermittent supplementation was as effective as daily supplementation in reducing the prevalence of anaemia and increasing haemoglobin concentrations, with fewer side effects. It may have reduced the risk of having iron deficiency also, but it had no effect on raising ferritin concentrations more than the daily dose. We found scarce evidence on the effect of intermittent supplementation compared to placebo or daily supplementation on iron deficiency anaemia, all-cause morbidity, disease outcomes, adherence, economic productivity, and work performance. The findings were not affected by whether the supplements were given once or twice weekly, for less or more than three months, contained less or more than 60 mg of elemental iron per week, or given to populations with different degrees of anaemia at baseline (starting point for comparisons). Intermittent iron supplementation in menstruating women may be an effective intervention for reducing anaemia and improving haemoglobin concentrations compared to no treatment, placebo or daily supplementation. Intermittent supplementation may be associated with fewer side effects compared to daily supplementation. The evidence base was of overall low quality."
CD013285,"We included four RCTs. The 86 participants had a wide range of disease severity (forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) ranged from 54% to 95%) and were 7 to 41 years old. Two RCTs were cross-over and two were parallel in design. Participants in one RCT were hospitalised with an acute respiratory exacerbation, whilst the participants in three RCTs were clinically stable. All four RCTs compared exercise either alone or in combination with another ACT, but these were too diverse to allow us to combine results. The certainty of the evidence was very low; we downgraded it due to low participant numbers and high or unclear risks of bias across all domains. Exercise versus active cycle of breathing technique (ACBT)
One cross-over trial (18 participants) compared exercise alone to ACBT. There was no change from baseline in our primary outcome FEV1, although it increased in the exercise group before returning to baseline after 30 minutes; we are unsure if exercise affected FEV1 as the evidence is very low-certainty. Similar results were seen for other measures of lung function. No adverse events occurred during the exercise sessions (very low-certainty evidence). We are unsure if ACBT was perceived to be more effective or was the preferred ACT (very low-certainty evidence). 24-hour sputum volume was less in the exercise group than with ACBT (secondary outcome). Exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics were not reported. Exercise plus postural drainage and percussion (PD&P) versus PD&P only
Two trials (55 participants) compared exercise and PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial narratively reported a greater increase in FEV1 % predicted with PD&P alone. At six months, the other trial reported a greater increase with exercise combined with PD&P, but did not provide data for the PD&P group. We are uncertain whether exercise with PD&P improves FEV1 as the certainty of evidence is very low. Other measures of lung function did not show clear evidence of effect. One trial reported no difference in exercise capacity (maximal work rate) after two weeks. No adverse events were reported (1 trial, 17 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Adherence was high, with all PD&P sessions and 96% of exercise sessions completed (1 trial, 17 participants; very low-certainty evidence). There was no difference between groups in 24-hour sputum volume or in the mean duration of hospitalisation, although the six-month trial reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Quality of life, ACT preference and need for antibiotics were not reported. Exercise versus underwater positive expiratory pressure (uPEP)
One trial (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group (very low-certainty evidence). Trial investigators reported that participants perceived exercise as more fatiguing but also more enjoyable than bubble PEP (very low-certainty evidence). There were no differences found in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The trial did not report the primary outcomes (FEV1, quality of life, exercise capacity) or the secondary outcomes (other measures of lung function, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations). As one of the top 10 research questions identified by clinicians and people with CF, it is important to systematically review the literature regarding whether or not exercise is an acceptable and effective ACT, and whether it can replace traditional methods. We identified an insufficient number of trials to conclude whether or not exercise is a suitable alternative ACT, and the diverse design of included trials did not allow for meta-analysis of results. The evidence is very low-certainty, so we are uncertain about the effectiveness of exercise as an ACT. Longer studies examining outcomes that are important to people with CF are required to answer this question.","The people in the studies were aged between 7 and 41 years and had varying degrees of disease severity. Three studies included people who were clinically well and one study included people admitted to hospital for a chest infection. The studies lasted between four days and six months and compared exercise (alone or in combination with another airway clearance technique) to other techniques. Exercise versus ACBT
One study (18 participants) found that a measure of lung function temporarily (up to 30 minutes) increased in the exercise group only, otherwise there was no difference between the ACBT or the exercise group. No adverse events were reported, and it is not certain if ACBT was thought to be more effective or was preferred. The exercise group produced less sputum than the ACBT group. The study did not report on exercise capacity, quality of life, adherence, hospitalisations and need for additional antibiotics. Exercise plus PD&P versus PD&P alone
Two studies (55 participants) compared exercise plus PD&P to PD&P alone. At two weeks, one trial described a greater increase in lung function with PD&P alone, while at six months the second study reported a greater increase with exercise plus PD&P (but did not provide data for the PD&P group). We did not find enough evidence to conclude whether or not exercise can replace other methods of airway clearance. We did not find any evidence to suggest that exercise was either better or worse than other methods to improve lung function or clear mucus from the airways, although exercising did improve people's exercise ability, and it was the preferred choice of treatment in one study. One study reported no side effects at all, and also reported no difference between groups in exercise capacity (maximal work rate), sputum volume or the average length of time spent in hospital. Conversely, the second study reported fewer hospitalisations due to exacerbations in the exercise and PD&P group. Neither study reported on quality of life, preference and the need for antibiotics. Exercise versus uPEP
One study (13 participants) compared exercise to uPEP (also known as bubble PEP). No adverse events were recorded in either group and investigators reported that those taking part thought that, while exercise was more tiring, it was also more enjoyable than bubble PEP. We found no differences in the total weight of sputum collected during treatment sessions. The study did not report on lung function, quality of life, exercise capacity, adherence, need for antibiotics or hospitalisations."
CD008041,"No new studies were found for this update. Thirteen studies (4222 participants) compared aspirin 900 mg or 1000 mg, alone or in combination with metoclopramide 10 mg, with placebo or other active comparators, mainly sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. For all efficacy outcomes, all active treatments were superior to placebo, with NNTs of 8.1, 4.9 and 6.6 for 2-hour pain-free, 2-hour headache relief, and 24-hour headache relief with aspirin alone versus placebo, and 8.8, 3.3 and 6.2 with aspirin plus metoclopramide versus placebo. Sumatriptan 50 mg did not differ from aspirin alone for 2-hour pain-free and headache relief, while sumatriptan 100 mg was better than the combination of aspirin plus metoclopramide for 2-hour pain-free, but not headache relief; there were no data for 24-hour headache relief. Adverse events were mostly mild and transient, occurring slightly more often with aspirin than placebo. Additional metoclopramide significantly reduced nausea (P < 0.00006) and vomiting (P = 0.002) compared with aspirin alone. We found no new studies since the last version of this review. Aspirin 1000 mg is an effective treatment for acute migraine headaches, similar to sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. Addition of metoclopramide 10 mg improves relief of nausea and vomiting. Adverse events were mainly mild and transient, and were slightly more common with aspirin than placebo, but less common than with sumatriptan 100 mg.","Oral sumatriptan 100 mg was better than aspirin plus metoclopramide for pain-free response at two hours, but otherwise there were no major differences between aspirin with or without metoclopramide and sumatriptan 50 mg or 100 mg. Adverse events with short-term use were mostly mild and transient, occurring slightly more often with aspirin than placebo, and more often with sumatriptan 100 mg than with aspirin. Addition of 10 mg of the antiemetic metoclopramide substantially increased relief of nausea and vomiting compared with aspirin alone, but made little difference to pain. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane review published in Issue 4, 2010 (Kirthi 2010); no new studies were found. A single oral dose of 1000 mg of aspirin reduced pain from moderate or severe to none by two hours in approximately 1 in 4 people (24%) taking aspirin, compared with about 1 in 10 (11%) taking placebo."
CD008638,"We pooled summary estimates from 10 trials evaluating SmartCare™ involving 654 participants. Overall, eight trials were judged to be at low or unclear risk of bias, and two trials were judged to be at high risk of bias. Compared with non-automated strategies, SmartCare™ decreased weaning time (mean difference (MD) -2.68 days, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.99 to -1.37; P value < 0.0001, seven trials, 495 participants, moderate-quality evidence), time to successful extubation (MD -0.99 days, 95% CI -1.89 to -0.09; P value 0.03, seven trials, 516 participants, low-quality evidence), length of ICU stay (MD -5.70 days, 95% CI -10.54 to -0.85; P value 0.02, six trials, 499 participants, moderate-quality evidence) and proportions of participants receiving ventilation for longer than seven and 21 days (risk ratio (RR) 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.85; P value 0.01 and RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.86; P value 0.02). SmartCare™ reduced the total duration of ventilation (MD -1.68 days, 95% CI -3.33 to -0.03; P value 0.05, seven trials, 521 participants, low-quality evidence) and the number of participants receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.00; P value 0.05); however the estimated effects were imprecise. SmartCare™ had no effect on time to first successful SBT, mortality or adverse events, specifically reintubation. Subgroup analysis suggested that trials with protocolized (versus non-protocolized) control weaning strategies reported significantly shorter ICU stays. Sensitivity analysis excluded two trials with high risk of bias and supported a trend toward significant reductions in weaning time favouring SmartCare™. Compared with non-automated weaning strategies, weaning with SmartCare™ significantly decreased weaning time, time to successful extubation, ICU stay and proportions of patients receiving ventilation for longer than seven days and 21 days. It also showed a favourable trend toward fewer patients receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days; however the estimated effect was imprecise. Summary estimates from our review suggest that these benefits may be achieved without increasing the risk of adverse events, especially reintubation; however, the quality of the evidence ranged from low to moderate, and evidence was derived from 10 small randomized controlled trials.","We identified 10 trials of moderate quality involving 654 participants and comparing SmartCare™ versus non-automated weaning strategies. Subgroup analyses suggested more beneficial effects on weaning time in trials comparing SmartCare™ to a protocolized weaning strategy versus a non-protocolized control strategy. Sensitivity analyses, which excluded two trials with high risk of bias, supported significant reductions in weaning time with SmartCare™. Compared with non-automated strategies, SmartCare™ significantly decreased weaning time, time to successful removal from breathing machines and time spent in the ICU, with fewer patients receiving breathing machine support for longer than seven days and 21 days, and no increase in adverse events. SmartCare™ also showed a favourable trend toward fewer patients receiving ventilation for longer than 14 days, with no increase in adverse events."
CD010425,"Eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria. Six of the trials provided data for this review and all of these were at high risk of bias. Six trials randomised a total of 815 participants to subcutaneous closure (410 participants) or no subcutaneous closure (405 participants). Overall, 7.7% of participants (63/815 of participants) developed superficial surgical site infections and there was no clear evidence of a difference between the two intervention groups (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.33; very low quality evidence). Only two trials reported superficial wound dehiscence, with 7.9% (17/215) of participants developing the problem. It is not clear whether the lack of reporting of this outcome in other trials was because it did not occur, or was not measured. There was no clear evidence of a between-group difference in the proportion of participants who developed superficial wound dehiscence in the trials that reported this outcome (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.41; very low quality evidence). Only one trial reported deep wound dehiscence, which occurred in 8.3% (5/60) of participants. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the proportion of participants who developed deep wound dehiscence between the two groups (RR 0.25; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.11; very low quality evidence). Three trials reported the length of hospital stay and found no significant difference between groups (MD 0.10 days; 95% CI -0.45 to 0.64; very low quality evidence). We do not know whether this review reveals a lack of effect or lack of evidence of effect. The confidence intervals for these outcomes were wide, and significant benefits or harms from subcutaneous closure cannot be ruled out. In addition, none of the trials assessed the impact of subcutaneous closure on quality of life, long-term patient outcomes (the follow-up period in the trials varied between one week and two months after surgery) or financial implications to the healthcare provider. There is currently evidence of very low quality which is insufficient to support or refute subcutaneous closure after non-caesarean operations. The use of subcutaneous closure has the potential to affect patient outcomes and utilisation of healthcare resources. Further well-designed trials at low risk of bias are necessary.","We identified six randomised controlled trials that reported one or more of the outcomes we thought were important. The six trials that provided data for this review included 815 participants (410 participants had subcutaneous closure of incisions and 405 participants did not). In the trials that reported the outcomes, overall 7% of participants developed superficial wound infection, 8% of participants developed superficial separation of wounds, and 8% of participants developed deeper separation of layers in both the groups but there was no clear evidence of a difference in incidence between the subcutaneous closure group and the no subcutaneous closure group. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the length of hospital stay between the groups. We do not know whether these results indicate that there is really no difference between subcutaneous closure and no subcutaneous closure, or that there are problems with study design that make it difficult to identify true differences between the two techniques. So significant benefits or harms of subcutaneous closure cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, no trial assessed the impact of subcutaneous closure on quality of life, long-term patient outcomes (trial follow-up periods varied between one week and two months after surgery) or financial implications to healthcare providers. There is currently no evidence to support or condemn subcutaneous closure after non-childbirth surgery. Further well-designed trials are necessary."
CD013706,"We included 11 studies in our review. Most studies explored healthcare workers' views and experiences about vaccination of older adults more broadly but also mentioned communication issues specifically. All studies were from high-income countries. The studies focused on doctors, nurses, pharmacists and others working in hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and nursing homes. These healthcare workers discussed different types of vaccines, including influenza, pneumococcal and herpes zoster vaccines. The review was carried out before COVID-19 vaccines were available. We downgraded our confidence in several of the findings from high confidence to moderate, low or very low confidence. One reason for this was that some findings were based on only small amounts of data. Another reason was that the findings were based on studies from only a few countries, making us unsure about the relevance of these findings to other settings. Healthcare workers reported that older adults asked about vaccination to different extents, ranging from not asking about vaccines at all, to great demand for information (high confidence finding). When the topic of vaccination was discussed, healthcare workers described a lack of information, and presence of misinformation, fears and concerns about vaccines among older adults (moderate confidence). The ways in which healthcare workers discussed vaccines with older adults appeared to be linked to what they saw as the aim of vaccination communication. Healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions of this aim and about their own roles and the roles of older adults in vaccine decisions. Some healthcare workers thought it was important to provide information but emphasised the right and responsibility of older adults to decide for themselves. Others used information to persuade and convince older adults to vaccinate in order to increase 'compliance' and 'improve' vaccination rates, and in some cases to gain financial benefits. Other healthcare workers tailored their approach to what they believed the older adult needed or wanted (moderate confidence). Healthcare workers believed that older adults' decisions could be influenced by several factors, including the nature of the healthcare worker–patient relationship, the healthcare worker's status, and the extent to which healthcare workers led by example (low confidence). Our review also identified factors that are likely to influence how communication between healthcare workers and older adults take place. These included issues tied to healthcare workers' views and experiences regarding the diseases in question and the vaccines; as well as their views and experiences of the organisational and practical implementation of vaccine services. There is little research focusing specifically on healthcare workers' perceptions and experiences of communication with older adults about vaccination. The studies we identified suggest that healthcare workers differed among themselves in their perceptions about the aim of this communication and about the role of older adults in vaccine decisions. Based on these findings and the other findings in our review, we have developed a set of questions or prompts that may help health system planners or programme managers when planning or implementing strategies for vaccination communication between healthcare workers and older adults.","We included 11 studies in our review.

CD012282,"One-hundred and forty-five trials (36 placebo controlled and 109 before and after) evaluated the dose-related efficacy of fluvastatin in 18,846 participants. The participants were of any age with and without evidence of cardiovascular disease, and fluvastatin effects were studied within a treatment period of three to 12 weeks. Log dose-response data over doses of 2.5 mg to 80 mg revealed strong linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and a weak linear dose-related effect on blood triglycerides. There was no dose-related effect of fluvastatin on blood HDL cholesterol. Fluvastatin 10 mg/day to 80 mg/day reduced LDL cholesterol by 15% to 33%, total cholesterol by 11% to 25% and triglycerides by 3% to 17.5%. For every two-fold dose increase there was a 6.0% (95% CI 5.4 to 6.6) decrease in blood LDL cholesterol, a 4.2% (95% CI 3.7 to 4.8) decrease in blood total cholesterol and a 4.2% (95% CI 2.0 to 6.3) decrease in blood triglycerides. The quality of evidence for these effects was judged to be high. When compared to atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, fluvastatin was about 12-fold less potent than atorvastatin and 46-fold less potent than rosuvastatin at reducing LDL cholesterol. Very low quality of evidence showed no difference in WDAEs between fluvastatin and placebo in 16 of 36 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 1.52 (95% CI 0.94 to 2.45). Fluvastatin lowers blood total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in a dose-dependent linear fashion. Based on the effect on LDL cholesterol, fluvastatin is 12-fold less potent than atorvastatin and 46-fold less potent than rosuvastatin. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with fluvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 56% of the placebo-controlled trials.","One-hundred and forty-five included trials involved 18,846 participants.

There was no dose-related effect of fluvastatin on blood HDL cholesterol. Fluvastatin 10 mg/day to 80 mg/day reduced LDL cholesterol by 15% to 33%. The quality of evidence was high for the lipid levels. For WDAEs the quality of evidence was very low because 20 (55.6%) out of 36 placebo-controlled trials did not report WDAEs. Based on the effect on LDL cholesterol, fluvastatin is 12-fold less potent than atorvastatin and 46-fold less potent than rosuvastatin. Of the 36 placebo-controlled trials only 16 reported withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs).

CD006196,"Of 241 records retrieved by the search, 17 trials conducted between 1961 and 2011, involving 2252 participants with follow-up from six weeks to two years, were included. Homogenous data demonstrated that instances of relapse were significantly higher in people receiving any intermittent drug treatment in the long term (n = 436, 7 RCTs, RR 2.46, 95% CI 1.70 to 3.54, moderate quality evidence). Intermittent treatment was shown to be more effective than placebo, however, and demonstrated that significantly less people receiving intermittent antipsychotics experienced full relapse by medium term (n = 290, 2 RCTs, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.58, very low quality evidence). Hospitalisation rates were higher for people receiving any intermittent drug treatment by long term (n = 626, 5 RCTs, RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.33 to 2.06, moderate quality evidence). Results demonstrated little difference in instances of tardive dyskinesia in groups with any intermittent drug technique versus maintenance therapy, with equivocal results (displaying slight heterogeneity) at long term (n = 165, 4 RCTs, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.30, low quality evidence). Results of this review support the existing evidence that intermittent antipsychotic treatment is not as effective as continuous, maintained antipsychotic therapy in preventing relapse in people with schizophrenia. More research is needed to assess any potential benefits or harm of intermittent treatment regarding adverse effects typically associated with maintained antipsychotic treatment, as well as any cost-effectiveness of this experimental treatment.","Relapse was significantly higher in people receiving intermittent drug treatment.

CD011167,"We included two RCTs, that randomised 514 pregnant women (347 women analysed) at a mean gestational age of 22 weeks. Both trials were conducted in the outpatient department of the same two hospitals in the USA between 1993 and 2001, and had a follow-up of 14 days. One of the trials was sponsored by a drug company. We considered both trials to be at a high risk of bias. One trial compared ceftriaxone (125 mg, intramuscular) with cefixime (400 mg, oral); the other trial had three arms, and assessed ceftriaxone (250 mg, intramuscular) versus either amoxicillin (3 g, oral) plus probenecid (1 g, oral) or spectinomycin (2 g, intramuscular). We did not include the spectinomycin data because this medication is no longer produced. We were unable to conduct meta-analysis because the trials compared different medications. We found inconclusive evidence that there were clear differences in the cure of gonococcal infections (genital, extragenital, or both) between intramuscular ceftriaxone versus oral amoxicillin plus oral probenecid (risk ratio (RR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.98 to 1.16; one RCT; 168 women; very low-quality evidence) or intramuscular ceftriaxone versus oral cefixime (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.08; one RCT; 95 women; very low-quality evidence). Neither of the trials reported on two of this review's primary maternal outcomes: incidence of obstetric complications (miscarriage, premature rupture of membranes, preterm delivery, or fetal death), or disseminated gonococcal infection, or on the incidence of neonatorum ophthalmia in the neonates. One trial reported one case of vomiting in the oral amoxacillin plus probenecid group. Trials reported pain at the injection sites, but did not quantify it. Hyperberbilurrubinemia was more frequent in neonates whose mothers were exposed to ceftriaxone. There were no clear differences between groups for neonatal malformation. This Cochrane Review found high levels of cure of gonococcal infections in pregnancy with the given antibiotic regimens. However, the evidence in this review is inconclusive as it does not support one particular regimen over another. This conclusion was based on very low-quality evidence (downgraded for poor trial design, imprecision) from two trials (involving 514 women), which we assessed to be at a high risk of bias for a number of domains. The harm profiles of the antibiotic regimes featured in this review remain unknown. High-quality RCTs are needed, with sufficient power to assess the clinical effectiveness and potential harms of antibiotics in pregnant women with gonorrhoea. These should be planned according to Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT),conducted following CONSORT recommendations, and based on Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) outcomes.","The trials randomised a total of 514 pregnant women (347 women analysed), at an average gestational age of 22 weeks. We searched for evidence in April 2017 and found two randomised controlled trials, conducted in outpatient departments of the same two hospitals in the USA, between 1993 and 2001. Both trials had a follow-up of 14 days. One trial was sponsored by a drug company. One trial compared ceftriaxone (125 mg, intramuscular) with cefixime (400 mg, oral), and the other trial assessed a higher dose of ceftriaxone (250 mg, intramuscular) versus either amoxicillin (3 g, oral) plus probenecid (1 g, oral) or spectinomycin (2 g, intramuscular). We did not include data from the spectinomycin group because this medication is no longer produced. We were unable to pool the results because the trials used different comparisons. We found no clear difference in the rate of cure of gonococcal infection (both genital and unrelated to the genital organs) for the different treatment groups, which was in the order of 89% to 96% (very low-quality evidence). Trials did not report on the incidence of obstetric complications, disseminated gonococcal infection in the mother, or ophthalmia neonatorum in the baby. One trial reported one case of vomiting in the oral amoxacillin plus probenecid group. Trials reported pain at the injection sites, but did not report numbers or severity. Hyperberbilurrubinemia (where the baby has too much bilirubin in the blood) was more frequent in newborns whose mothers were exposed to ceftriaxone. There was no clear difference between groups for neonatal malformation. We found high levels of cure of gonococcal infection in pregnancy with the given antibiotic regimens, but here was not enough evidence to support one particular regimen over another. Therefore, there is a need for high-quality trials to be conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness and potential harms of antibiotics for treating gonorrhoea in pregnancy women."
CD012714,"We included three trials, with a total of 112 participants. Risk of bias was low for the included studies. Two pharmaceutical company-sponsored trials compared modafinil with placebo, involving 102 participants, nearly all of whom had idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep time. Modafinil significantly improved self-reported sleepiness on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale by 5.08 points more than placebo (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.01 to 7.16; 2 studies, 101 participants; high-certainty evidence). Modafinil also significantly improved disease severity on the Clinical Global Impression of Severity scale by 1.02 points (95% CI 0.11 to 1.93; 1 study, 30 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and resulted in a greater proportion of participants who were ""much improved"" or ""very much improved"" on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (odds ratio (OR) for improvement 5.14, 95% CI 1.76 to 15.00; 1 study, 70 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Ability to remain awake on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test was significantly improved with modafinil, by 4.74 minutes more than with placebo (95% CI 2.46 to 7.01; 2 studies, 99 participants; high-certainty evidence). Ratings of exhaustion and effectiveness/performance were improved with modafinil compared to placebo in one study. Number of naps per week was no different between modafinil and placebo across two studies. Participants receiving modafinil experienced more side effects, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.68, 95% CI 0.28 to 9.94; 2 studies, 102 participants; low-certainty evidence). One trial studying 20 participants with different disorders of sleepiness included 10 participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, with or without long sleep time, and compared clarithromycin to placebo. We only included the subset of trial data for those participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, per our protocol. There were no significant differences between clarithromycin and placebo for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, psychomotor vigilance testing, sleep inertia, other subjective ratings, or side effects. Modafinil is effective for the treatment of several aspects of idiopathic hypersomnia symptomatology, based on studies predominantly including participants with idiopathic hypersomnia without long sleep times, with low risk of bias, and evidence certainty ranging from high to low. There is insufficient evidence to conclude whether clarithromycin is effective for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia. There is a clear need for additional studies testing interventions for the treatment of idiopathic hypersomnia.","The two studies testing modafinil included a total of 102 people with idiopathic hypersomnia. Modafinil improves sleepiness and the ability to stay awake during testing in a sleep laboratory. Both studies compared modafinil to placebo, lasted for three weeks, and were funded by pharmaceutical companies with commercial interest in the results of the studies. The study testing clarithromycin included a total of 20 participants, from a single sleep clinic in the USA, 10 of whom had idiopathic hypersomnia. This study compared clarithromycin to placebo. We only included information for the 10 people with idiopathic hypersomnia in the review. It is uncertain whether there is a difference in side effects between clarithromycin and placebo, based on the information included in this review. It is uncertain whether or not clarithromycin helps with daytime sleepiness or other symptoms of idiopathic hypersomnia. We found very few studies testing medication treatments for idiopathic hypersomnia. More studies are needed before we can be certain which medications are best for treating people with idiopathic hypersomnia."
CD008524,"The updated search identified no new RCTs. We identified 47 studies, involving approximately 1,223,856 children. Studies were set in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of these in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. Most studies included equal numbers of girls and boys and lasted about one year. The mean age of the children was about 33 months. The included studies were at variable overall risk of bias; however, evidence for the primary outcome was at low risk of bias. A meta-analysis for all-cause mortality included 19 trials (1,202,382 children). At longest follow-up, there was a 12% observed reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality for VAS compared with control using a fixed-effect model (risk ratio (RR) 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 0.93; high-certainty evidence). Nine trials reported mortality due to diarrhoea and showed a 12% overall reduction for VAS (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.98; 1,098,538 children; high-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of a difference for VAS on mortality due to measles (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.11; 6 studies, 1,088,261 children; low-certainty evidence), respiratory disease (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.12; 9 studies, 1,098,538 children; low-certainty evidence), and meningitis. VAS reduced the incidence of diarrhoea (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.87; 15 studies, 77,946 children; low-certainty evidence), measles (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.67; 6 studies, 19,566 children; moderate-certainty evidence), Bitot's spots (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.53; 5 studies, 1,063,278 children; moderate-certainty evidence), night blindness (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.50; 2 studies, 22,972 children; moderate-certainty evidence), and VAD (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78; 4 studies, 2262 children, moderate-certainty evidence). However, there was no evidence of a difference on incidence of respiratory disease (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 11 studies, 27,540 children; low-certainty evidence) or hospitalisations due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. There was an increased risk of vomiting within the first 48 hours of VAS (RR 1.97, 95% CI 1.44 to 2.69; 4 studies, 10,541 children; moderate-certainty evidence). This update identified no new eligible studies and the conclusions remain the same. VAS is associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in morbidity and mortality in children. Further placebo-controlled trials of VAS in children between six months and five years of age would not change the conclusions of this review, although studies that compare different doses and delivery mechanisms are needed. In populations with documented VAD, it would be unethical to conduct placebo-controlled trials.","The update identified no new studies. The review includes 47 RCTs representing 1,223,856 children. Studies took place in 19 countries: 30 (63%) in Asia, 16 of which were in India; 8 (17%) in Africa; 7 (15%) in Latin America, and 2 (4%) in Australia. About one-third of the studies were in urban/periurban settings, and half were in rural settings; the remaining studies did not clearly report settings. Most studies included equal numbers of boys and girls and lasted about one year. The average age of the children was about 33 months. The data on the effect of VAS for the prevention of death were available from 19 of the included studies, and the combined results indicate that VAS reduces overall risk of death and death due to diarrhoea by 12%. VAS does not specifically reduce death due to measles, respiratory infections, or meningitis, but it can reduce new occurrences of diarrhoea and measles. There was no effect on incidence of respiratory disease or admissions to hospital due to diarrhoea or pneumonia. This update did not identify and new eligible studies and the conclusions remain the same. In summary, VAS can reduce risk of illness and death in children aged 6 to 59 months of age who are at risk of VAD."
CD010047,"Two RCTs were included in the review (106 participants). Neither study reported live birth rate. Vitrification was associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate compared to slow freezing (RR 3.86, 95% CI 1.63 to 9.11, P = 0.002, 2 RCTs, 106 women, I2 = 8%, moderate quality evidence). The effect of vitrification compared to slow freezing on ongoing pregnancy rates was only reported in one small study, with inconclusive findings (RR 6.07, 95% CI 0.86 to 43.04, P = 0.07, one RCT, 28 women, low quality evidence). No data were reported on adverse effects, nor were any other outcomes reported in the included trials. The evidence was limited by imprecision. We assessed the included studies as at low to unclear risk of bias as the methods were not well described. Oocyte vitrification compared to slow freezing probably increases clinical pregnancy rates in women undergoing assisted reproduction. However, the total number of women and pregnancies were low and the imprecision is high which limits applicability. The effect on ongoing pregnancy is uncertain as data were sparse. No data were available on live births or adverse effects.","We found two randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 106 participants comparing oocyte vitrification versus slow freezing. Neither study reported live births or adverse events as outcomes. One reported ongoing pregnancy and both reported clinical pregnancy. The clinical pregnancy rate was higher in the oocyte vitrification group than in the slow freezing group. The effect of vitrification compared to slow freezing on ongoing pregnancy rates was only reported in the one small study, with inconclusive findings. The evidence was limited by imprecision. Characteristics of the included studies."
CD001008,"We included three new trials in this update, which brings the total to 14 included studies that compared hypnotherapy with 22 different control interventions. The studies included a total of 1926 participants. Studies were diverse and a single meta-analysis was not possible. We judged only one study to be at low risk of bias overall; we judged 10 studies to be at high risk of bias and three at unclear risk. Studies did not provide reliable evidence of a greater benefit from hypnotherapy compared with other interventions or no treatment for smoking cessation. Most individual studies did not find statistically significant differences in quit rates after six months or longer, and studies that did detect differences typically had methodological limitations. Pooling small groups of relatively comparable studies did not provide reliable evidence for a specific effect of hypnotherapy relative to controls. There was low certainty evidence, limited by imprecision and risk of bias, that showed no statistically significant difference between hypnotherapy and attention-matched behavioural treatments (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.61; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 957 participants). Results were similarly imprecise, and also limited by risk of bias, when comparing hypnotherapy to intensive behavioural interventions (not matched for contact time) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.82; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 211 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results from one small study (40 participants) detected a statistically significant benefit of hypnotherapy compared to no intervention (RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 305.88), but this evidence was judged to be of very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecision. No significant differences were detected in comparisons of hypnotherapy with brief behavioural interventions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.69; I² = 0%; 2 studies, 269 participants), rapid/focused smoking (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.33; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 54 participants), and pharmacotherapies (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.20; I2 = 5%; 2 studies, 197 participants). When hypnotherapy was evaluated as an adjunct to other treatments, the pooled result from five studies showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of hypnotherapy (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.35; I² = 62%; 224 participants); however, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias across studies (four had a high risk or bias, one had an unclear risk), and substantial statistical heterogeneity. Most studies did not provide information on whether data specifically relating to adverse events were collected, and whether or not any adverse events occurred. One study that did collect such data did not find a statistically significant difference in the adverse event ‘index’ between hypnotherapy and relaxation. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypnotherapy is more effective for smoking cessation than other forms of behavioural support or unassisted quitting. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. There is very little evidence on whether hypnotherapy causes adverse effects, but the existing data show no evidence that it does. Further large, high-quality randomized controlled trials, and more comprehensive assessments of safety, are needed on this topic.","We found 14 studies comparing hypnotherapy with other approaches to help people stop smoking (including brief advice, or more intensive stop-smoking counselling), or no treatment. Overall, 1926 people were included. The studies varied greatly in terms of the treatments they compared, so it was difficult to combine their results. When we combined the results of six studies (with a total of 957 people) there was no evidence that hypnotherapy helped people quit smoking more than behavioural interventions, such as counselling, when delivered over the same amount of time. There was also no evidence that there was a difference between hypnotherapy and longer counselling programmes when we combined results from two studies (269 people). One study compared hypnotherapy with no treatment and found an effect in favour of hypnotherapy, but the study was small (40 people) and had issues with its methods, which means we cannot be certain about this finding. Five studies looked at adding hypnotherapy to existing treatments and found an effect, but the studies were at high risk of bias and there were large, unexplained differences in their findings. One study that compared hypnotherapy and relaxation found no difference in side effects. There is no clear evidence that hypnotherapy is better than other approaches in helping people to stop smoking. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. Larger, high-quality studies are needed."
CD009861,"We included 27 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), involving 2319 participants, that assessed melatonin for treating preoperative anxiety, postoperative anxiety, or both. Twenty-four studies compared melatonin with placebo. Eleven studies compared melatonin to a benzodiazepine (seven studies with midazolam, three studies with alprazolam, and one study with oxazepam). Other comparators in a small number of studies were gabapentin, clonidine, and pregabalin. No studies were judged to be at low risk of bias for all domains. Most studies were judged to be at unclear risk of bias overall. Eight studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in one or more domain, and thus, to be at high risk of bias overall. Melatonin versus placebo
Melatonin probably results in a reduction in preoperative anxiety measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0 to 100 mm) compared to placebo (mean difference (MD) -11.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.80 to -9.59; 18 studies, 1264 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), based on a meta-analysis of 18 studies. Melatonin may reduce immediate postoperative anxiety measured on a 0 to 100 mm VAS compared to placebo (MD -5.04, 95% CI -9.52 to -0.55; 7 studies, 524 participants; low-certainty evidence), and may reduce delayed postoperative anxiety measured six hours after surgery using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) (MD -5.31, 95% CI -8.78 to -1.84; 2 studies; 73 participants; low-certainty evidence). Melatonin versus benzodiazepines (midazolam and alprazolam)
Melatonin probably results in little or no difference in preoperative anxiety measured on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (MD 0.78, 95% CI -2.02 to 3.58; 7 studies, 409 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and there may be little or no difference in immediate postoperative anxiety (MD -2.12, 95% CI -4.61 to 0.36; 3 studies, 176 participants; low-certainty evidence). Adverse events
Fourteen studies did not report on adverse events. Six studies specifically reported that no side effects were observed, and the remaining seven studies reported cases of nausea, sleepiness, dizziness, and headache; however, no serious adverse events were reported. Eleven studies measured psychomotor and cognitive function, or both, and in general, these studies found that benzodiazepines impaired psychomotor and cognitive function more than placebo and melatonin. Fourteen studies evaluated sedation and generally found that benzodiazepine caused the highest degree of sedation, but melatonin also showed sedative properties compared to placebo. Several studies did not report on adverse events; therefore, it is not possible to conclude with certainty, from the data on adverse effects collected in this review, that melatonin is better tolerated than benzodiazepines. When compared with placebo, melatonin given as premedication (as tablets or sublingually) probably reduces preoperative anxiety in adults (measured 50 to 120 minutes after administration), which is potentially clinically relevant. The effect of melatonin on postoperative anxiety compared to placebo (measured in the recovery room and six hours after surgery) was also evident but was much smaller, and the clinical relevance of this finding is uncertain. There was little or no difference in anxiety when melatonin was compared with benzodiazepines. Thus, melatonin may have a similar effect to benzodiazepines in reducing preoperative and postoperative anxiety in adults.","We found 27 randomized studies involving 2319 adult participants that looked at the effects of melatonin given before surgery on the level of anxiety both before and after surgery. Twenty-four studies compared melatonin with placebo, and 11 studies compared melatonin with benzodiazepine drugs. Benzodiazepine (midazolam, oxazepam, or alprazolam) doses ranged from 0.25 to 15 mg or from 0.05 to 0.2 mg/kg. Gabapentin, pregabalin, and clonidine were also compared with melatonin in some studies. Melatonin reduced anxiety before surgery when compared to placebo (18 studies, 1264 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Giving melatonin before surgery may effectively reduce anxiety before surgery, but any reduction in anxiety after surgery with melatonin is less clear when compared with placebo. Melatonin may have similar effects to benzodiazepines on the level of anxiety before surgery (7 studies, 409 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and immediately after surgery (3 studies, 176 participants; low-certainty evidence). Fourteen studies did not report on adverse events, six studies reported that no side effects were observed, and seven studies reported cases of nausea, sleepiness, dizziness, and headache. No serious adverse events were reported. Benzodiazepines interfered with psychomotor and cognitive function more than placebo and melatonin (in 11 studies). They caused the greatest degree of sedation, although melatonin also showed sedation compared to placebo (14 studies). We are moderately confident that melatonin reduces anxiety preoperatively compared with placebo. Effects on immediate and delayed postoperative anxiety after surgery are less clear when compared with placebo (low-quality evidence). We did not find any evidence that melatonin differs in antianxiety effects from benzodiazepines (moderate- and low-quality evidence)."
CD015511,"The search of electronic databases identified 7141 citations, with a further 287 records identified from the search of trial registries and Google Scholar. Of the 110 studies (116 records) evaluated in full text, we considered 88 to be ineligible for inclusion for the following reasons: inappropriate outcome (27 studies); intervention (12 studies); study design (31 studies); and participants (18 studies).

CD007992,"We included two trials with a total of 37 children diagnosed with ASD who were randomised into groups that received either omega-3 fatty acids supplementation or a placebo. We excluded six trials because they were either non-randomised controlled trials, did not contain a control group, or the control group did not receive a placebo. Overall, there was no evidence that omega-3 supplements had an effect on social interaction (mean difference (MD) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.84 to 4.48, I2 = 0%), communication (MD 0.62, 95% CI -0.89 to 2.14, I2 = 0%), stereotypy (MD 0.77, 95% CI -0.69 to 2.22, I2 = 8%), or hyperactivity (MD 3.46, 95% CI -0.79 to 7.70, I2 = 0%). To date there is no high quality evidence that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation is effective for improving core and associated symptoms of ASD. Given the paucity of rigorous studies in this area, there is a need for large well-conducted randomised controlled trials that examine both high and low functioning individuals with ASD, and that have longer follow-up periods.","We found only two small randomised controlled trials that evaluated omega-3 fatty acids for ASD. The purpose of this review was to assess the evidence for the effectiveness of omega-3 supplementation for core features of ASD and associated symptoms. There is insufficient evidence that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation is an effective treatment for ASD. However, high quality large randomised controlled trials are needed before definite recommendations about this treatment can be made."
CD006966,"We included three studies, involving 146 participants. Two studies were assessed as being at high risk of bias. The main finding of the review was that the two techniques may be equally successful at exposing PDCs (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.06; three studies, 141 participants analysed, low-quality evidence). One surgical failure was due to detachment of the gold chain (closed group). One study reported on complications following surgery and found two in the closed group: a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate. We were unable to pool data for dental aesthetics, patient-reported pain and discomfort, periodontal health and treatment time; however, individual studies did not find any differences between the surgical techniques (low- to very low-quality evidence). Currently, the evidence suggests that neither the open or closed surgical technique for exposing palatally displaced maxillary canine teeth is superior for any of the outcomes included in this review; however, we considered the evidence to be low quality, with two of the three included studies being at high risk of bias. This suggests the need for more high-quality studies. Three ongoing clinical trials have been identified and it is hoped that these will produce data that can be pooled to increase the degree of certainty in these findings.","Authors with Cochrane Oral Health found three relevant studies, involving 146 participants who had eye teeth displaced in the roof of the mouth, either on one or both sides. Two studies were designed in a way that made them likely to be biased. Five out of 141 participants analysed were surgical failures, one of which was due to the complication of detachment of the gold chain during surgery. One study reported complications after surgery and found one participant in the closed group had a post-operative infection requiring antibiotics and another participant in the closed group experienced pain during alignment of the canine as the gold chain penetrated through the gum tissue of the palate. We were unable to combine results from studies for any other outcomes, but individual studies did not show evidence of a difference between the two techniques for pain, discomfort, appearance, gum health, length of treatment time or cost (low to very low quality evidence). It does not seem that one surgical technique is better than the other for moving displaced eye teeth into the correct position, or for other outcomes, but this finding is uncertain because the quality of the evidence is low. This suggests the need for more high-quality studies. Three studies are currently in process."
CD006754,"We included a total of 20 studies with 2068 participants. We studied the anticonvulsant drugs carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin. All studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo. Only one study had one arm by which the anticonvulsant was compared with the antidepressant desipramine. Upon comparison of anticonvulsant versus placebo, we found no significant differences for any of the efficacy and safety measures. Dropouts: risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05, 17 studies, 20 arms, 1695 participants, moderate quality of evidence. Use of cocaine: RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.02, nine studies, 11 arms, 867 participants, moderate quality of evidence; side effects: RR 1.39, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.90, eight studies, 775 participants; craving: standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.25, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.09, seven studies, eight arms, 428 participants, low quality of evidence. Although caution is needed when results from a limited number of small clinical trials are assessed, no current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsant medications in the treatment of patients with cocaine dependence. Although the findings of new trials will improve the quality of study results, especially in relation to specific medications, anticonvulsants as a category cannot be considered first-, second- or third-line treatment for cocaine dependence.","The review authors identified 20 studies with 2068 participants, 77% male, with a mean age of 36 years. The anticonvulsant drugs studied were carbamazepine, gabapentin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, tiagabine, topiramate and vigabatrin. All studies compared anticonvulsants versus placebo. No significant differences were found between placebo and any anticonvulsant in reducing the number of dropouts from treatment, use of cocaine, craving and severity of dependence, depression or anxiety. The quality of the evidence was moderate for the outcomes dropout and use of cocaine, and was low for the outcomes side effects and craving. No current evidence supports the clinical use of anticonvulsant medications for the treatment of cocaine dependence."
CD008890,"We could not identify any studies in which the only difference between the treatment groups was the use of intracystic bleomycin. We did identify a RCT comparing intracystic bleomycin with intracystic phosphorus32 (32P) (seven children). In this update we identified no additional studies. The included study had a high risk of bias. Survival could not be evaluated. There was no clear evidence of a difference between the treatment groups in cyst reduction (MD -0.15, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.69 to 0.39, P value = 0.59, very low quality of evidence), neurological status (Fisher's exact P value = 0.429, very low quality of evidence), third nerve paralysis (Fischer's exact P value = 1.00, very low quality of evidence), fever (RR 2.92, 95% CI 0.73 to 11.70, P value = 0.13, very low quality of evidence) or total adverse effects (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.68 to 4.53, P value = 0.25, very low quality of evidence). There was a significant difference in favour of the 32P group for the occurrence of headache and vomiting (Fischer's exact P value = 0.029, very low quality of evidence for both outcomes). Since we identified no RCTs, quasi-randomised trials or CCTs of the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas in children in which only the use of intracystic bleomycin differed between the treatment groups, no definitive conclusions could be made about the effects of intracystic bleomycin in these patients. Only one low-power RCT comparing intracystic bleomycin with intracystic 32P treatment was available, but no definitive conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of these agents in children with cystic craniopharyngiomas. Based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for the use of intracystic bleomycin in the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas in children. High-quality RCTs are needed.","We could not identify any randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which the only difference between the intervention and control group was the use of intracystic bleomycin. However, we did identify one RCT comparing intracystic bleomycin with intracystic phosphorus32 (32P), which is a radioactive isotope of phosphorous used for intracystic irradiation. The study has a high risk of bias and the sample size is too small to detect a difference in outcomes. Although there was no significant difference in total adverse effects between the two treatment groups, there was a significant difference in both headache and vomiting in favour of the 32P group. The therapeutic use of intracystic bleomycin in children with cystic craniopharyngiomas currently remains uncertain. More high-quality studies are needed but will be difficult as so few children get these tumours."
CD008268,"We included one new RCT in this update, for a total of nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children and 950 adults). In eight trials, participants in both corticosteroid and placebo groups received antibiotics; one trial offered delayed prescription of antibiotics based on clinical assessment. Only two trials reported funding sources (government and a university foundation). In addition to any effect of antibiotics and analgesia, corticosteroids increased the likelihood of complete resolution of pain at 24 hours by 2.40 times (risk ratio (RR) 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 4.47; P = 0.006; I² = 67%; high-certainty evidence) and at 48 hours by 1.5 times (RR 1.50, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.76; P < 0.001; I² = 0%; high-certainty evidence). Five people need to be treated to prevent one person continuing to experience pain at 24 hours. Corticosteroids also reduced the mean time to onset of pain relief and the mean time to complete resolution of pain by 6 and 11.6 hours, respectively, although significant heterogeneity was present (moderate-certainty evidence). At 24 hours, pain (assessed by visual analogue scales) was reduced by an additional 10.6% by corticosteroids (moderate-certainty evidence). No differences were reported in recurrence/relapse rates, days missed from work or school, or adverse events for participants taking corticosteroids compared to placebo. However, the reporting of adverse events was poor, and only two trials included children or reported days missed from work or school. The included studies were assessed as moderate quality evidence, but the small number of included studies has the potential to increase the uncertainty, particularly in terms of applying these results to children. Oral or intramuscular corticosteroids, in addition to antibiotics, moderately increased the likelihood of both resolution and improvement of pain in participants with sore throat. Given the limited benefit, further research into the harms and benefits of short courses of steroids is needed to permit informed decision-making.","We added one new trial (565 participants) for a total nine trials involving 1319 participants (369 children, 950 adults). Participants received either a single dose of steroids or a single dose of a dummy drug (placebo) (7 trials). In eight trials all participants also received antibiotics immediately on entry to the study. Two studies described funding sources (government and a university foundation). We assessed the certainty of the evidence as high for complete resolution of pain at 24 and 48 hours, and moderate for mean time to onset of pain relief, mean time to complete resolution of pain, absolute reduction in pain measured by visual analogue scales, adverse events, recurrence/relapse rates, and days missed from work or school. Adverse events, recurrence/relapse rates, and days missed from work or school did not differ between corticosteroid and placebo group participants. Sore throats are very common in children, but only two trials reported results for children, and these results were inconsistent, making it difficult to draw conclusions. Further research is therefore needed to examine the benefits of corticosteroids for both reducing antibiotic use in people with severe sore throat, and the benefit for children specifically."
CD006172,"There were 15 included studies (6008 enrolled participants); 13 studies contributed data. Women using home uterine monitoring were less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 34 weeks (risk ratio (RR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.99; three studies, 1596 women; fixed-effect analysis) (GRADE high). This difference was not evident when we carried out a sensitivity analysis, restricting the analysis to studies at low risk of bias based on study quality (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.00; one study, 1292 women). There was no difference in the rate of perinatal mortality (RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.72; two studies, 2589 babies) (GRADE low). There was no difference in the number of preterm births at less than 37 weeks (average RR 0.85, CI 0.72 to 1.01; eight studies, 4834 women; random-effects, Tau2 = 0.03, I2 = 68%) (GRADE very low). Infants born to women using home uterine monitoring were less likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care unit (average RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.96; five studies, 2367 babies; random-effects, Tau2 = 0.02, I2 = 32%) (GRADE moderate). This difference was not maintained when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.01; one study, 1292 babies). Women using home uterine monitoring made more unscheduled antenatal visits (mean difference (MD) 0.48, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.64; two studies, 1994 women) (GRADE moderate). Women using home uterine monitoring were also more likely to have prophylactic tocolytic drug therapy (average RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.45; seven studies, 4316 women; random-effects, Tau2 = 0.03, I2 = 62%), but this difference was no longer evident when we restricted the analysis to studies at low risk of bias (average RR 1.22, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.65; three studies, 3749 women; random-effects, Tau2 = 0.05, I2 = 76%) (GRADE low). The number of antenatal hospital admissions did not differ between home groups (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.11; three studies, 1494 women (GRADE low)). We found no data on maternal anxiety or acceptability. Home uterine monitoring may result in fewer admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit but in more unscheduled antenatal visits and tocolytic treatment; the level of evidence is generally low to moderate. Important group differences were not evident when we undertook sensitivity analysis using only trials at low risk of bias. There is no impact on maternal and perinatal outcomes such as perinatal mortality or incidence of preterm birth.","We searched for evidence on 28 June 2016 and found 15 randomised studies, involving 6008 women. Women using monitors were no less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 37 or 32 weeks of pregnancy (GRADE very low). Women using monitors were less likely to experience preterm birth at less than 34 weeks, but when we analysed only high-quality studies, no clear difference remained (GRADE high). Babies born to women using the monitor were less likely to be admitted to neonatal intensive care (GRADE moderate) but there were no fewer deaths (GRADE low). Women using the monitor were more likely to make an unscheduled antenatal visit (GRADE moderate), but the number of antenatal hospital admissions did not differ (GRADE low). Women using monitors appeared to be more likely to receive tocolysis (treatment to stop labour) (GRADE low), but when we looked only at high-quality studies there was no clear difference. We found no data to assess women's views, although one large trial reported low compliance with monitor use. Home uterine monitoring may result in fewer admissions to a neonatal intensive care unit, but more unscheduled antenatal visits and treatment for preterm labour. The level of evidence is generally low to moderate."
CD011413,"We included 12 studies (803 children) in this review and meta-analysis. We identified three studies that are awaiting classification and two ongoing studies. Trial results show that a longer intubation time was required when indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, was used instead of direct laryngoscopy (12 trials; n = 798; mean difference (MD) 5.49 seconds, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.37 to 9.60; I2 = 90%; very low-quality evidence). Researchers found no significant differences between direct and indirect laryngoscopy on assessment of success of the first attempt at intubation (11 trials; n = 749; risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.02; I2 = 67%; low-quality evidence) and observed that unsuccessful intubation (five trials; n = 263) was significantly increased in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (RR 4.93, 95% CI 1.33 to 18.31; I2 = 0%; low-quality evidence). Five studies reported the effect of intubation on oxygen saturation (n = 272; very low-quality evidence). Five children had desaturation during intubation: one from the direct laryngoscopy group and four from the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. Two studies (n = 100) reported other haemodynamic responses to intubation (very low-quality evidence). One study reported a significant increase in heart rate five minutes after intubation in the indirect laryngoscopy group (P = 0.007); the other study found that the heart rate change in the direct laryngoscopy group was significantly less than the heart rate change in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group (P < 0.001). A total of five studies (n = 244; very low-quality evidence) looked at evidence of trauma resulting from intubation. Investigators reported that only two children from the direct laryngoscopy group had trauma compared with no children in the indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, group. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, improved the percentage of glottic opening (five trials; n = 256). Studies noted no significant difference in Cormack and Lehane score (C&L) grade 1 (three trials; n = 190; RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.21; I2 = 59%). Evidence suggests that indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, leads to prolonged intubation time with an increased rate of intubation failure when compared with direct laryngoscopy (very low-quality evidence due to imprecision, inconsistency, and study limitations). Review authors had difficulty reaching conclusions on adverse haemodynamic responses and other adverse effects of intubation, as only a few children were reported to have these outcomes. Use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, might lead to improved vocal cord view, but marked heterogeneity between studies made it difficult for review authors to reach conclusions on this outcome.","We found 12 randomized controlled trials (803 children) that met our inclusion criteria. We reran the search in January 2017 and will include the three studies awaiting classification when we update the review. For intubation, use of indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, took longer and was more likely to be unsuccessful (very low-quality evidence). No significant difference was found between direct and indirect laryngoscopy when success of the first attempt at intubation was assessed (low-quality evidence). Only a few studies reported the effect of intubation on adverse haemodynamic response, including changes in oxygen saturation, heart rate, and trauma to the mouth and windpipe. We reviewed the evidence on how effective indirect laryngoscopy, or videolaryngoscopy, is when compared with direct laryngoscopy for intubation in children from 28 days to 18 years old. Therefore, it was difficult to conclude on the overall adverse effect (very low-quality evidence). Indirect laryngoscopy might provide better views of the vocal cords."
CD002197,"Twenty trials comparing open mesh with open non-mesh repair were identified. Open mesh methods, on average, took 7-10 minutes less to perform than Shouldice procedures, but took 1-4 minutes longer than other non-mesh methods. There were no clear differences between mesh and non-mesh groups for haematomas, seromas or wound/superficial infections. Three serious operative compications were reported after open mesh repair and three following non-mesh repair. Overall, those in the mesh groups had a shorter length of hospital stay and quicker return to usual activities, but this pattern was not observed for all trials. There was a suggestion that persisting pain was less frequent after mesh repair than after non-mesh repair but this result was dependent on one trial and data were not available for 11 trials. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups with respect to persisting numbness. Fewer hernia recurrences were reported after mesh repair (Peto OR: 0.37, 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.51). There were too few data to reliably address differential effects for patients with recurrent, bilateral or femoral hernias. Two trials comparing flat mesh with plug and mesh were identified. There was no clear evidence of differences between the groups. There is evidence that the use of open mesh repair is associated with a reduction in the risk of recurrence of between 50% and 75%. Although the trials were heterogenous there is also some evidence of quicker return to work and of lower rates of persisting pain following mesh repair.","Open mesh methods were shorter to perform than Shouldice procedures, but took longer than other types of non-mesh repair. We found no clear differences between mesh and non-mesh methods for operative complications and persisting numbness. Overall, people spent less time in hospital and returned to their usual activities quicker after mesh repair but this pattern was not observed for all studies. There was a suggestion that people had less persisting pain after mesh repair but results were only available for nine out of 20 trials. There was strong evidence that fewer hernias recur after mesh repair than following non-mesh repair. We found 20 studies comparing mesh with non-mesh repair and two studies comparing flat mesh with plug and mesh. We did not find clear evidence of differences between flat mesh repair and plug and mesh repair."
CD009242,"This is an update of a Cochrane review from 2011, which included five trials. This update includes seven studies on treadmill intervention in 175 children: 104 were allocated to treadmill groups, and 71 were controls. The studies varied in population (children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, developmental delay or at moderate risk for neuromotor delay); comparison type (treadmill versus no treadmill; treadmill with versus without orthoses; high- versus low-intensity training); study duration, and assessed outcomes. Due to the diversity of the studies, only data from five studies were used in meta-analyses for five outcomes: age of independent walking onset, overall gross motor function, gross motor function related to standing and walking, and gait velocity. GRADE assessments of quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low. The effects of treadmill intervention on independent walking onset compared to no treadmill intervention was population dependent, but showed no overall effect (mean difference (MD) -2.08, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -5.38 to 1.22, 2 studies, 58 children; moderate-quality evidence): 30 children with Down syndrome benefited from treadmill training (MD -4.00, 95% CI -6.96 to -1.04), but 28 children at moderate risk of developmental delay did not (MD -0.60, 95% CI -2.34 to 1.14). We found no evidence regarding walking onset in two studies that compared treadmill intervention with and without orthotics in 17 children (MD 0.10, 95% CI -5.96 to 6.16), and high- versus low-intensity treadmill interventions in 30 children with Down syndrome (MD -2.13, 95% -4.96 to 0.70). Treadmill intervention did not improve overall gross motor function (MD 0.88, 95% CI -4.54 to 6.30, 2 studies, 36 children; moderate-quality evidence) or gross motor skills related to standing (MD 5.41, 95% CI -1.64 to 12.43, 2 studies, 32 children; low-quality evidence), and had a negligible improvement in gross motor skills related to walking (MD 4.51, 95% CI 0.29 to 8.73, 2 studies, 32 children; low-quality evidence). It led to improved walking skills in 20 ambulatory children with developmental delay (MD 7.60, 95% CI 0.88 to 14.32, 1 study) and favourable gross motor skills in 12 children with cerebral palsy (MD 8.00, 95% CI 3.18 to 12.82). A study which compared treadmill intervention with and without orthotics in 17 children with Down syndrome suggested that adding orthotics might hinder overall gross motor progress (MD -8.40, 95% CI -14.55 to -2.25). Overall, treadmill intervention showed a very small increase in walking speed compared to no treadmill intervention (MD 0.23, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.37, 2 studies, 32 children; high-quality evidence). Treadmill intervention increased walking speed in 20 ambulatory children with developmental delay (MD 0.25, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.42), but not in 12 children with cerebral palsy (MD 0.18, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.45). This update of the review from 2011 provides additional evidence of the efficacy of treadmill intervention for certain groups of children up to six years of age, but power to find significant results still remains limited. The current findings indicate that treadmill intervention may accelerate the development of independent walking in children with Down syndrome and may accelerate motor skill attainment in children with cerebral palsy and general developmental delay. Future research should first confirm these findings with larger and better designed studies, especially for infants with cerebral palsy and developmental delay. Once efficacy is established, research should examine the optimal dosage of treadmill intervention in these populations.","We included seven studies on treadmill intervention on 175 children with Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, general developmental delay or children with moderate risk for delay. Treadmill training versus no treadmill training was compared in five studies, including 117 children with one of the above mentioned risks. Treadmill training with or without orthotics (braces) was examined in 22 children with Down syndrome. High-intensity versus low-intensity treadmill training was compared in 36 children with Down syndrome. Standardized assessment for quality of evidence ranged from high to very low. Quality of evidence was determined by the number of children studied, completeness of the data, and random group assignment. Compared to no treadmill intervention, treadmill training helped 30 children with Down syndrome to walk earlier, but did not help 28 infants at moderate risk for developmental delay. Overall, treadmill intervention did not improve overall gross motor function or gross motor skills related to standing. However, 20 ambulatory children with developmental delay, who engaged in treadmill training at preschool, improved walking skills. One study, which compared treadmill intervention with and without orthotics in 17 children with Down syndrome, suggested that adding orthotics might hinder gross motor progress. Confirmation from larger studies is necessary. Once efficacy of the intervention is established, optimal dosage research is needed."
CD009115,"We included 14 studies with 923 participants in this review. Studies took place in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA. Six of the 14 included studies were funded by government agencies and one was funded by a university grant. The rest were funded by charitable foundations or trusts. Each study compared phonics training alone, or in conjunction with one other reading-related skill, to either no training (i.e. treatment as usual) or alterative training (e.g. maths). Participants were English-speaking children or adolescents, of low and middle socioeconomic status, whose reading was one year, one grade, or one standard deviation below the level expected for their age or grade for no known reason. Phonics training varied between studies in intensity (up to four hours per week), duration (up to seven months), training group size (individual and small groups), and delivery (human and computer). We measured the effect of phonics training on seven primary outcomes (mixed/regular word reading accuracy, non-word reading accuracy, irregular word reading accuracy, mixed/regular word reading fluency, non-word reading fluency, reading comprehension, and spelling). We judged all studies to be at low risk of bias for most risk criteria, and used the GRADE approach to assess the quality of the evidence. There was low-quality evidence that phonics training may have improved poor readers' accuracy for reading real and novel words that follow the letter-sound rules (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.51, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.13 to 0.90; 11 studies, 701 participants), and their accuracy for reading words that did not follow these rules (SMD 0.67, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.07; 10 studies, 682 participants). There was moderate-quality evidence that phonics training probably improved English-speaking poor readers' fluency for reading words that followed the letter-sounds rules (SMD 0.45, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.72; 4 studies, 224 participants), and non-word reading fluency (SMD 0.39, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.68; 3 studies, 188 participants), as well as their accuracy for reading words that did not follow these rules (SMD 0.84, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.39; 4 studies, 294 participants). In addition, there was low-quality evidence that phonics training may have improved poor readers' spelling (SMD 0.47, 95% CI –0.07 to 1.01; 3 studies, 158 participants), but only slightly improve their reading comprehension (SMD 0.28, 95% CI –0.07 to 0.62; 5 studies, 343 participants). Phonics training appears to be effective for improving literacy-related skills, particularly reading fluency of words and non-words, and accuracy of reading irregular words. More studies are needed to improve the precision of outcomes, including word and non-word reading accuracy, reading comprehension, spelling, letter-sound knowledge, and phonological output. More data are also needed to determine if phonics training in English-speaking poor readers is moderated by factors such as training type, intensity, duration, group size, or administrator.","The search, updated in May 2018, identified 14 studies that tested phonics training in 923 English-speaking poor readers. The studies took place in Australia, Canada, the UK, and the USA. Six of the 14 included studies were funded by government agencies and one was funded by a university grant. The rest were funded by charitable foundations or trusts. Each study compared phonics training alone, or with one other reading-related skill, to either no training (i.e. treatment as usual) or alterative training (e.g. maths). Participants were English-speaking children or adolescents, of low and middle socioeconomic status, whose reading was one year, one grade, or one standard deviation (distance from the average) below the level expected for their age or grade for no known reason. Phonics training varied between studies in frequency (up to four hours per week), duration (up to seven months), training group size (individual and small groups), and delivery (human and computer). We measured the effect of phonics training on poor readers' ability to read words and novel words (non-words) accurately and fluently, as well as their comprehension of text, and their knowledge of letter-sound rules (letter-sound knowledge) and speech sounds (phonological output). We found that phonics training in English-speaking poor readers probably improved irregular word reading accuracy, mixed/regular word reading fluency, and non-word reading fluency. The evidence suggests that phonics training can improve literacy in English-speaking poor readers. The positive effects of phonics training on all reading-related outcomes suggests that phonics training is not harmful for poor readers. More studies are needed to improve the precision of the outcomes."
CD009330,"We identified three randomised clinical trials, involving a total of 120 participants, comparing packed red blood cells with ≥ 21 days storage ('prolonged' or 'older') versus packed red blood cells with < 21 days storage ('fresh'). We pooled data to assess the effect of prolonged storage on death from any cause. The confidence in the results from these trials was very low, due to the bias in their design and their limited sample sizes. The estimated effect of packed red blood cells with ≥ 21 days storage versus packed red blood cells with < 21 days storage for the outcome death from any cause was imprecise (5/45 [11.11%] versus 2/46 [4.34%]; RR 2.36; 95% CI 0.65 to 8.52; I2: 0%, P = 0.26, very low quality of evidence). Trial sequential analysis, with only two trials, shows that we do not yet have convincing evidence that older packed red blood cells induce a 20% relative risk reduction of death from any cause compared with fresher packed red blood cells. No trial included other outcomes of interest specified in this review, namely transfusion-related acute lung injury, postoperative infections, and adverse events. The safety profile is unknown. Recognising the limitations of the review, relating to the size and nature of the included trials, this Cochrane Review provides no evidence to support or reject the use of packed red blood cells for blood transfusion which have been stored for ≥ 21 days ('prolonged' or 'older') compared with those stored for < 21 days ('fresh'). These results are based on three small single centre trials with high risks of bias. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of fresh or older packed red blood cells for blood transfusion. Therefore, we urge readers to interpret the trial results with caution. The results from four large ongoing trials will help to inform future updates of this review.","We identified three studies, involving a total of 120 participants, comparing packed red blood cells stored for ≥ 21 days versus < 21 days. The results of the studies for the outcome death from any cause were uncertain due to the small number of participants who contributed information. The level of confidence in the results of this review is very low. None of the trials considered the other outcomes of interest in this review, namely transfusion-related acute lung injury, postoperative infections, and adverse events. The safety profiles of the two approaches are unknown. We are aware of four large ongoing trials in this area which will help us to better understand the effects of storage on red blood cells in relation to outcomes for patients."
CD011784,"We included only one study in this review, which compared two surgical interventions: pedicled buccal fat pad flap and buccal flap for the treatment of oro-antral communications. The study involved 20 participants. The risk of bias was unclear. The relevant outcome reported in this trial was successful (complete) closure of oro-antral communication. The quality of the evidence for the primary outcome was very low. The study did not find evidence of a difference between interventions for the successful (complete) closure of an oro-antral communication (RR 1.00, 95% Cl 0.83 to 1.20) one month after the surgery. All oro-antral communications in both groups were successfully closed so there were no adverse effects due to treatment failure. We did not find trials evaluating any other intervention for treating oro-antral communications or fistulae due to dental procedures. We found very low quality evidence from a single small study that compared pedicled buccal fat pad and buccal flap. The evidence was insufficient to judge whether there is a difference in the effectiveness of these interventions as all oro-antral communications in the study were successfully closed by one month after surgery. Large, well-conducted RCTs investigating different interventions for the treatment of oro-antral communications and fistulae caused by dental procedures are needed to inform clinical practice.","Only one study, which was conducted in Iran, is included in our review. Participants were divided into two groups and two surgical treatments were compared for treating oro-antral communications; one group was treated with pedicled buccal fat pad flap (PBFPF) and the other with buccal flap (BF). The study ran for two years and involved 20 people with OAC aged between 25 and 56 years. It may not be possible to generalise these findings because the quality of the evidence was very low, due to unclear risk of bias and the small numbers studied in the single included trial. The study did not find evidence of a difference between PBFPF and BF in terms of successful (complete) closure of OAC. The evidence currently available is insufficient to draw reliable conclusions regarding the effects of interventions used to treat OAC or fistulae due to dental procedures. Both interventions resulted in successful closure by one month after surgery. More well-designed and well-reported trials evaluating different interventions are needed to provide reliable evidence to inform clinical decisions."
CD005263,"For this update, we included seven additional studies, making a total of 21 included studies, which involved a total of 1400 participants: 635 received SET, 320 received HBET, and 445 received WA. In general, SET and HBET programs consisted of three exercise sessions per week. Follow-up ranged from six weeks to two years. Most trials used a treadmill walking test to investigate effects of exercise therapy on walking capacity. However, two trials assessed only quality of life, functional impairment, and/or walking behavior (i.e., daily steps measured by pedometer). The overall methodological quality of included trials was moderate to good. However, some trials were small with respect to numbers of participants, ranging from 20 to 304. SET groups showed clear improvement in MWD/T compared with HBET and WA groups, with overall SMDs at three months of 0.37 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12 to 0.62; P = 0.004; moderate-quality evidence) and 0.80 (95% CI 0.53 to 1.07; P < 0.00001; high-quality evidence), respectively. This translates to differences in increased MWD of approximately 120 and 210 meters in favor of SET groups. Data show improvements for up to six and 12 months, respectively. The HBET group did not show improvement in MWD/T compared with the WA group (SMD 0.30, 95% CI -0.45 to 1.05; P = 0.43; moderate-quality evidence). Compared with HBET, SET was more beneficial for PFWD/T but had no effect on quality of life parameters nor on self-reported functional impairment. Compared with WA, SET was more beneficial for PFWD/T and self-reported functional impairment, as well as for some quality of life parameters (e.g., physical functioning, pain, and physical component summary after 12 months), and HBET had no effect. Data show no obvious effects on mortality rates. Thirteen of the 1400 participants died, but no deaths were related to exercise therapy. Overall, adherence to SET was approximately 80%, which was similar to that reported with HBET. Only limited adherence data were available for WA groups. Evidence of moderate and high quality shows that SET provides an important benefit for treadmill-measured walking distance (MWD and PFWD) compared with HBET and WA, respectively. Although its clinical relevance has not been definitively demonstrated, this benefit translates to increased MWD of 120 and 210 meters after three months in SET groups. These increased walking distances are likely to have a positive impact on the lives of patients with IC. Data provide no clear evidence of a difference between HBET and WA. Trials show no clear differences in quality of life parameters nor in self-reported functional impairment between SET and HBET. However, evidence is of low and very low quality, respectively. Investigators detected some improvements in quality of life favoring SET over WA, but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants. Future studies should focus on disease-specific quality of life and other functional outcomes, such as walking behavior and physical activity, as well as on long-term follow-up.","We included 21 trials in which a total of 1400 participants with intermittent claudication (65% male, mean age 66 years) had been assigned to supervised exercise therapy, home-based exercise therapy, or walking advice (search last run December 2016). Trials lasted from six weeks to two years. The overall methodological quality of included trials was moderate to good. However, some trials had enrolled only small numbers of participants. Compared with home-based exercise therapy, supervised exercise therapy was more beneficial for pain-free walking distance but had no effect on quality of life measures nor on self-reported functional impairment. Compared with walking advice, supervised exercise therapy was more beneficial for pain-free walking distance and self-reported functional impairment, as well as for some quality of life measures (e.g., physical functioning, pain, and physical component summary after 12 months), and home-based exercise therapy had no effect. Data show no obvious effects on mortality rates. Thirteen of the 1400 participants died, but no deaths were related to exercise therapy. Overall, adherence to supervised exercise therapy was approximately 80%, which was similar to that reported with home-based exercise therapy. Only limited adherence data were available for walking advice groups. Evidence of moderate and high quality shows that supervised exercise therapy improves walking distance (maximal and pain-free) to a greater extent than home-based exercise therapy and walking advice, respectively. Before participating in the exercise program, the maximal walking distance of participants was 290 meters with a pain-free walking distance of 140 meters, so this improvement is likely to have a positive impact on their lives. Trials show no clear differences in quality of life measures nor in self-reported functional impairment between supervised exercise therapy and home-based exercise therapy. However, evidence is of low and very low quality, respectively. Investigators detected some improvements in quality of life favoring supervised exercise therapy over walking advice, but analyses were limited by small numbers of studies and participants. More research is needed on disease-specific quality of life and other functional outcomes, such as walking behavior and physical activity, as well as on long-term follow-up."
CD011077,"No trials on modification of food met the inclusion criteria. We included two studies that examined modification to fluids. Both were part of the same large multicentre trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. Participation in the second trial was determined by results from the first trial. With unpublished data supplied by study authors, we examined data from participants with dementia only. The first study, a cross-over trial, investigated the immediate effects on aspiration of two viscosities of liquids (nectar thick and honey thick) compared to regular liquids in 351 participants with dementia using videofluoroscopy. Regular liquids with a chin down head posture, as well as regular liquids without any intervention were also compared. The sequence of interventions during videofluoroscopy may have influenced response to intervention. The second study, a parallel designed RCT, compared the effect of nectar and honey thick liquids with a chin down head posture over a three-month period in a subgroup of 260 participants with dementia. Outcomes were pneumonia and adverse intervention effects. Honey thick liquids, which are more consistent with descriptors for 'spoon thick' or 'extremely thick' liquids, showed a more positive impact on immediate elimination of aspiration during videofluoroscopy, but this consistency showed more adverse effects in the second follow-up study. During the second three-month follow-up trial, there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia in participants receiving honey thick liquids than those receiving nectar thick liquids or taking regular liquids with a chin down posture. There were no deaths classified as 'definitely related' to the type of fluids prescribed. Neither trial addressed quality of life. Risk of bias for both studies is high. The overall quality of evidence for outcomes in this review is low. We are uncertain about the immediate and long-term effects of modifying the consistency of fluid for swallowing difficulties in dementia as too few studies have been completed. There may be differences in outcomes depending on the grade of thickness of fluids and the sequence of interventions trialled in videofluoroscopy for people with dementia. Clinicians should be aware that while thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallowing, the long-term impact of thickened fluids on the health of the person with dementia should be considered. Further high-quality clinical trials are required.","We found two studies, which were both part of the same multicentre trial and included people with dementia and people with or without dementia and Parkinson's disease. We included data on people with dementia only. The first of the two studies looked at the immediate effects of two viscosities of liquids compared to regular thin liquids on aspiration (entry of food or fluid into the lungs) in 351 people with dementia. This study also compared drinking regular thin liquids using a chin down head posture as well as drinking regular thin liquids without any changes to head position; the main outcome was fluid entering the lungs. Using a subgroup of 260 people with dementia from the first study, the second study compared the effect of the same liquid viscosities with a chin down head posture. The effectiveness of these interventions on the incidence of pneumonia and adverse effects of these interventions was examined over a three-month period. Honey thick viscosity liquids, which clinically are similar to descriptions of 'very thick liquids', had a more positive immediate impact on preventing fluid entering the lungs when examined during videofluoroscopy (specialised swallow x-ray) examination. However, during the three-month follow-up period there were a greater number of incidents of pneumonia in the group of people with dementia receiving these honey thick liquids, than those receiving nectar thick liquids and those receiving regular thin liquids with a chin down posture. There were no deaths classified as 'definitely related' to the type of liquids that the person with dementia was receiving. The overall risk of bias of included studies is high. The quality of evidence is low. While thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallow function, clinicians should consider the effects of this intervention on the person with dementia in the longer-term. People with dementia on thickened fluids require long-term follow-up. Further well-designed research is needed."
CD006250,"We included 18 trials reporting on 4843 participants comparing the effect of bisphosphonate administration to control regimens. Primary outcome: there was no clear difference in the proportion of participants with pain response (RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.43; P = 0.20; I2 = 0%; 3 trials; 876 participants; low quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in a pain response in 40 more participants per 1000 (19 fewer to 114 more). Secondary outcomes: bisphosphonates probably reduced the incidence of skeletal-related events in participants with prostate cancer metastatic to bone (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.94; P = 0.27; I2 = 19%; 9 trials; 3153 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 58 fewer SREs per 1000 (85 fewer to 27 fewer). We found no clinically relevant differences in mortality (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04; P = 0.43; I2 = 1%; 9 trials; 2450 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 16 fewer deaths per 1000 (47 fewer to 21 more). Outcome definition of quality of life and the measurement tools varied greatly across trials and we were unable to extract any quantitative data for meta-analysis. Bisphosphonates probably increased the number of participants affected by nausea (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41; P = 0.05; I2 = 0%; 9 trials; 3008 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in seven more cases of nausea per 1000 (0 fewer to 14 more). Bisphosphonates probably increased the number of renal adverse events (RR 1.65, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.46; P = 0.01; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 1794 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 22 more renal adverse events per 1000 (4 more to 50 more). We found no clear difference in the number of participants with osteonecrosis of the jaw between groups (RR 1.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 4.90; P = 0.17; I2 = 0%; 5 trials; 1626 participants; very low quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in seven more cases with osteonecrosis of the jaw per 1000 (2 fewer to 29 more). We observed no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of participants with decreased analgesic consumption (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.63; P = 0.28; I2 = 37%; 4 trials; 416 participants). Statistical analysis revealed that bisphosphonates probably reduced the number of participants with disease progression (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.90 to 0.98; P = 0.006; I2 = 0%; 7 trials; 2115 participants; moderate quality evidence). In absolute terms, bisphosphonates resulted in 36 fewer cases of disease progression per 1000 (71 fewer to 7 fewer). Findings of our predefined subgroup and sensitivity analyses were no different from those of the primary analyses. Based on low quality evidence, there may be no clinically relevant difference in the proportion of men with pain response between bisphosphonates and control regimens in men with bone metastases from prostate cancer. Bisphosphonates probably decrease the number of skeletal-related events and disease progression. These benefits need to be weighed against the increased risk of renal impairment and nausea in men receiving bisphosphonates. Future studies should explicitly evaluate patient important outcomes such as quality of life and pain by using standardized and comparable assessment tools.","This led to the inclusion of 18 clinical trials. We found low quality evidence that bisphosphonates provided no clinically relevant difference in pain response (three studies involving 876 men) compared to placebo (pretend treatment) or no additional treatment. Bisphosphonates reduced pain in 40 more men per 1000 men (19 fewer to 114 more). We found moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably resulted in 58 fewer skeletal-related events per 1000 (85 fewer to 27 fewer). We judged the quality of evidence as moderate to very low. We observed moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably increased the number of men with nausea. Bisphosphonates resulted in seven more men with nausea per 1000 men (0 fewer to 14 more). We found moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably increased the number of men with kidney problems. In this case, bisphosphonates resulted in 22 more men with renal complications per 1000 men (4 more to 50 more). For osteonecrosis of the jaw (where the jaw bone weakens and dies), we found very low quality evidence that bisphosphonates showed no clear difference. We observed moderate quality evidence that bisphosphonates probably decreased the number of men affected by disease progression (where the disease got worse). This means that bisphosphonates resulted in 36 fewer men with disease progression per 1000 men (71 fewer to 7 fewer)."
CD012241,"We included 21 trials, recruiting 14,241 infants. Five of the trials were conducted in high-income countries and the remaining 16 were conducted in middle- and low-income countries. Meta-analysis showed that nutrition education targeted at improving weaning-related feeding practices probably increases both weight-for-age z scores (WAZ) (MD 0.15 standard deviations, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.22; 6 studies; 2551 infants; I² = 32%; moderate-certainty evidence) and height-for-age z scores (0.12 standard deviations, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.19; 7 studies; 3620 infants; I² = 49%; moderate-certainty evidence) by 12 months of age. Meta-analysis of outcomes at 18 months of age was heterogeneous and inconsistent in the magnitude of effects of nutrition education on WAZ and weight-for-height z score across studies. One trial that assessed effects of nutrition education on growth at six years reported an uncertain effect on change in height and body mass index z score. Two studies investigated effects of nutrition education on neurodevelopment at 12 to 24 months of age with conflicting results. No trials assessed effects of nutrition education on long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Nutrition education for families of infants may reduce the risk of undernutrition in term-born infants (evidence of low to moderate certainty due to limitations in study design and substantial heterogeneity of included studies). Modest effects on growth during infancy may not be of clinical significance. However, it is unclear whether these small improvements in growth parameters in the first two years of life affect long-term childhood growth and development. Further studies are needed to resolve this question.","We examined research published up to December 2019 and found 21 clinical trials recruiting 14,241 babies. Five studies were undertaken in high-income countries, but the findings reported could not be included and pooled together in this review. We found that giving nutrition education about appropriate feeding practices during weaning to families in low- to moderate-income settings may improve weight and height at 12 months of age. We are very uncertain about the effects of nutrition education on children's development and risk of anaemia at one year of age, as only two studies reported each of these outcomes. We did not find any studies that assessed the effects of nutrition education on children's risk of overweight and obesity and reported outcomes that could be pooled together in this review. The certainty of evidence for the reduction in risk of childhood undernutrition with nutrition education is low to moderate at best due to limitations in study design and differences among the studies included in our review. The amount of improvement in growth noted is small and of unclear clinical significance. Further research is needed to determine whether nutrition education can reduce risks of overnutrition and obesity in children."
CD002142,"We identified 14 trials evaluating surgery versus surgery plus radiotherapy. Individual participant data were available for 11 of these trials, and our analyses are based on 2343 participants (1511 deaths). Results show a significant adverse effect of PORT on survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.18, or an 18% relative increase in risk of death. This is equivalent to an absolute detriment of 5% at two years (95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 9%), reducing overall survival from 58% to 53%. Subgroup analyses showed no differences in effects of PORT by any participant subgroup covariate. We did not undertake analysis of the effects of PORT on quality of life and adverse events. Investigators did not routinely collect quality of life information during these trials, and it was unlikely that any benefit of PORT would offset the observed survival disadvantage. We considered risk of bias in the included trials to be low. Results from 11 trials and 2343 participants show that PORT is detrimental to those with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer and should not be used in the routine treatment of such patients. Results of ongoing RCTs will clarify the effects of modern radiotherapy in patients with N2 tumours.","These studies brought together available trial data from all over the world, with 11 trials and 2343 patients. Researchers reported no difference in effects of PORT by types of patients included in trials. The impact of any data not included in our analyses is small. Researchers did not routinely collect quality of life information during the trials, and it was unlikely that any benefit of PORT would offset the observed survival disadvantage. Radiotherapy given after successful removal of tumour at operation is not beneficial for patients with non-small cell lung cancer and should not be used as routine treatment; however, further research into new types of radiotherapy for patients at higher risk of recurrence is ongoing."
CD003137,"We included 18 RCTs (7208 participants), of which 16 recruited adults and adolescents (6872) and two recruited children six to 17 years of age (336) with asthma and significant reversibility to bronchodilator at baseline. Fourteen (79%) trials were of high methodological quality. The risk of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids (primary outcome of the review) was significantly lower with the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS—from 13% to 11% (eight studies, 5923 adults and 334 children; risk ratio (RR) 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 0.99; high-quality evidence). The number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) with LABA compared with LTRA to prevent one additional exacerbation over four to 102 weeks was 62 (95% CI 34 to 794). The choice of LTRA, the dose of ICS and the participants' age group did not significantly influence the magnitude of effect. Although results were inconclusive, the effect appeared stronger in trials that used a single device rather than two devices to administer ICS and LABA and in trials of less than 12 weeks' duration. The addition of LABA to ICS was associated with a statistically greater improvement from baseline in lung function, as well as in symptoms, rescue medication use and quality of life, although the latter effects were modest. LTRA was superior in the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm. More participants were satisfied with the combination of LABA + ICS than LTRA + ICS (three studies, 1625 adults; RR 1.12, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.20; moderate-quality evidence). The overall risk of withdrawal was significantly lower with LABA + ICS than with LTRA + ICS (13 studies, 6652 adults and 308 children; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.96; moderate-quality evidence). Although the risk of overall adverse events was equivalent between the two groups, the risk of serious adverse events (SAE) approached statistical significance in disfavour of LABA compared with LTRA (nine studies, 5658 adults and 630 children; RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.79; P value 0.06; moderate-quality evidence), with no apparent impact of participants' age group. The following adverse events were reported, but no significant differences were demonstrated between groups: headache (11 studies, N = 6538); cardiovascular events (five studies, N = 5163), osteopenia and osteoporosis (two studies, N = 2963), adverse events (10 studies, N = 5977 adults and 300 children). A significant difference in the risk of oral moniliasis was noted, but this represents a low occurrence rate. In adults with asthma that is inadequately controlled by predominantly low-dose ICS with significant bronchodilator reversibility, the addition of LABA to ICS is modestly superior to the addition of LTRA in reducing oral corticosteroid–treated exacerbations, with an absolute reduction of two percentage points. Differences favouring LABA over LTRA as adjunct therapy were observed in lung function and, to a lesser extend, in rescue medication use, symptoms and quality of life. The lower overall withdrawal rate and the higher proportion of participants satisfied with their therapy indirectly favour the combination of LABA + ICS over LTRA + ICS. Evidence showed a slightly increased risk of SAE with LABA compared with LTRA, with an absolute increase of one percentage point. Our findings modestly support the use of a single inhaler for the delivery of both LABA and low- or medium-dose ICS. Because of the paucity of paediatric trials, we are unable to draw firm conclusions about the best adjunct therapy in children.","From available evidence until December 2012, we found 16 trials involving 6872 adults and two trials involving 336 children contributing to the review. The risk of asthma exacerbations requiring the use of corticosteroids was lower with the combination of LABA + ICS compared with LTRA + ICS—from 13% to 11%. The choice of LTRA (montelukast or zafirlukast), the dose of ICS and the age of patients did not significantly affect the results. The effect appeared stronger in trials of short duration and in those using a single device to administer both ICS and LABA. The combination of LABA + ICS was superior to LTRA + ICS in terms of lung function and was modestly superior in other indicators of the control of asthma and quality of life. LTRA was found superior in preventing deterioration during exercise. More patients were satisfied with the combination of LABA + ICS, and fewer changed therapy if they started with LABA instead of LTRA. The risk of withdrawal from a trial for any reason was significantly lower with LABA than with LTRA. In adults whose asthma is inadequately controlled with ICS, the addition of LABA to ICS was found to be modestly superior to LTRA + ICS. Although both options appeared safe, evidence suggests that slightly more serious adverse events (SAE) may be seen with LABA than with LTRA, particularly when separate devices are used to administer LABA + ICS. Because only two paediatric trials contributed data to the review, the best adjunct strategy to ICS remains uncertain for children."
CD007214,"Seventeen trials with 1466 women contribute data to the review. Thirteen examined TENS applied to the back, two to acupuncture points, and two to the cranium. Overall, there was little difference in pain ratings between TENS and control groups, although women receiving TENS to acupuncture points were less likely to report severe pain (average risk ratio 0.41, 95% confidence interval 0.31 to 0.54; measured in two studies). The majority of women using TENS said they would be willing to use it again in a future labour. Where TENS was used as an adjunct to epidural analgesia there was no evidence that it reduced pain. There was no consistent evidence that TENS had any impact on interventions and outcomes in labour. There was little information on outcomes for mothers and babies. No adverse events were reported. There is only limited evidence that TENS reduces pain in labour and it does not seem to have any impact (either positive or negative) on other outcomes for mothers or babies. The use of TENS at home in early labour has not been evaluated. TENS is widely available in hospital settings and women should have the choice of using it in labour.","The review includes results from 17 studies with a total of 1466 women. Thirteen studies examined TENS applied to the back, two to acupuncture points and two to the cranium (head). Results show that pain scores were similar in women using TENS and in control groups. Many women said they would be willing to use TENS again in a future labour. There was some evidence that women using TENS were less likely to rate their pain as severe but results were not consistent. TENS did not seem have an effect on the length of labour, interventions in labour, or the well-being of mothers and babies. It is not known whether TENS would help women to manage pain at home in early labour. Although it is not clear that it reduces pain, women should have the choice of using TENS in labour if they think it will be helpful."
CD003076,"We included in this review seven RCTs involving 1839 randomised participants with comparable treatment arms. All seven had fundamental problems including high exclusion rates, partial hospital treatment of many in the home treatment arms, and comparison of UFH in hospital versus LMWH at home. These trials showed that patients treated at home with LMWH were less likely to have recurrence of VTE events than those given hospital treatment with UFH or LMWH (fixed-effect risk ratio (RR) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 0.86; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.007; low-quality evidence). No clear difference was seen between groups for major bleeding (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.33 to 1.36; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.27; low-quality evidence), minor bleeding (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.78; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.11; low-quality evidence), or mortality (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.44 to 1.09; 6 studies; 1708 participants; P = 0.11; low-quality evidence). The included studies reported no cases of venous gangrene. We could not combine patient satisfaction and quality of life outcomes in meta-analysis owing to heterogeneity of reporting, but two of three studies found evidence that home treatment led to greater improvement in quality of life compared with in-patient treatment at some point during follow-up, and the third study reported that a large number of participants chose to switch from in-patient care to home-based care for social and personal reasons, suggesting it is the patient's preferred option (very low-quality evidence). None of the studies included in this review carried out a full cost-effectiveness analysis. However, a small randomised economic evaluation of the two alternative treatment settings involving 131 participants found that direct costs were higher for those in the in-patient group. These findings were supported by three other studies that reported on their costs (very low-quality evidence). Quality of evidence for data from meta-analyses was low to very low. This was due to risk of bias, as many of the included studies used unclear randomisation techniques, and blinding was a concern for many. Also, indirectness was a concern, as most studies included a large number of participants randomised to the home (LMWH) treatment group who were treated in hospital for some or all of the treatment period. A further issue for some outcomes was heterogeneity that was evident in measurement and reporting of outcomes. Low-quality evidence suggests that patients treated at home with LMWH are less likely to have recurrence of VTE than those treated in hospital. However, data show no clear differences in major or minor bleeding, nor in mortality (low-quality evidence), indicating that home treatment is no worse than in-patient treatment for these outcomes. Because most healthcare systems are moving towards more LMWH usage in the home setting it is unlikely that additional large trials will be undertaken to compare these treatments. Therefore, home treatment is likely to become the norm, and further research will be directed towards resolving practical issues by devising local guidelines that include clinical prediction rules, developing biomarkers and imaging that can be used to tailor therapy to disease severity, and providing training for community healthcare workers who administer treatment and monitor treatment progress.","Seven randomised controlled trials involving 1839 patients with clinically confirmed DVT compared home (LMWH) versus hospital (unfractionated heparin, or LMWH in one trial) treatment. Trials had limitations, including high exclusion rates and designs that did not take into account short hospital stays for any of the people treated at home to allow fair comparison of heparin in hospital with LMWH at home. Trials showed that patients treated at home with LMWH had less recurrence of VTE than hospital-treated patients. The review showed no clear differences between treatment groups for major bleeding, minor bleeding, or death. No study reported venous gangrene. We could not pool information on patient satisfaction and quality of life, as studies had different ways of reporting these, but two of the three studies reporting on quality of life provided evidence that home treatment led to greater improvement in quality of life compared with in-patient treatment, at some point during follow-up. The third study reported that a large number of participants chose to switch from in-patient care to home-based care for social and personal reasons, indicating that home treatment was better accepted than in-patient treatment. Overall, the quality of evidence of the available data was low to very low owing to risk of bias, indirectness, and differences in measuring and reporting of outcomes. Risk of bias is a concern, as many of the included studies did not fully explain how they randomised and allocated participants to treatments, and blinding techniques described were not clear. Another concern of reviewers was that in some studies, participants randomised to home treatment actually ended up being treated in hospital but remained in their assigned treatment for the analysis (this is known as indirectness). A further concern regarding a few of outcomes is variation in the way outcomes were measured and reported."
CD009938,"We included three RCTs involving a total of 2303 participants: 1150 participants were randomized to receive TDC and 1153 participants were randomized to receive medical therapy. Overall, the risk of bias was regarded as high. The mean follow-up period of all three included trials was less than five years. Baseline characteristics (age, sex, and vascular risk factors) were similar across trials. Intention-to-treat analyses did not show a statistically significant risk reduction in the composite endpoint of recurrent stroke or TIA in the TDC group when compared with medical therapy (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.17). A time-to-event analysis combining the results of two RCTs also failed to show a significant risk reduction with TDC (HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.13). When assessing stroke prevention alone, TDC still did not show a statistically significant benefit (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.27) (HR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.18). In a sensitivity analysis including the two studies using the Amplatzer PFO occluder, TDC showed a possible protective effect on recurrent stroke compared with medical therapy (HR 0.38, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.02); however, it did not reach statistical significance. Safety analysis found that the overall risks for all-cause mortality and adverse events were similar in both the TDC and medical therapy groups. However, TDC increased the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation (RR 3.50, 95% CI 1.47 to 8.35) and may be associated with the type of device used. The combined data from recent RCTs have shown no statistically significant differences between TDC and medical therapy in the prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke. TDC closure was associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation but not with serious adverse events.","We included in our analysis three multicenter randomized trials involving a total of 2303 participants. 1150 participants were randomized to the TDC group where the procedure was performed with the Amplatzer device in two studies, and with the STARFlex device in one study. The mean follow-up period of all three included trials was less than five years. We found that, when compared with medical therapy, TDC failed to show any significant benefit in reducing the risk of recurrent stroke or similar events. However, there was a possible protective effect on recurrent strokes in those participants for whom an Amplatzer device was used compared with medical therapy. However, TDC increased the risk of new-onset atrial fibrillation (where there is a problem with the rate or rhythm of the heartbeat) and may be associated with the type of device used. Although there is a suggestion of potential benefit with the Amplatzer device closure in preventing recurrent stroke, our findings still need to be confirmed in further studies. We did not find evidence that TDC increased the rate of serious adverse events overall."
CD009328,"Five randomised studies involving 1466 women met the inclusion criteria. All studies were classified as having an unclear risk of bias. Two studies (involving 1097 women) compared oral methylergometrine with a placebo, and one (involving 171 women) compared oral methylergometrine with Kyuki-chouketsu-in, a Japanese traditional herbal medicine. The remaining two studies (involving 198 women) did not report the outcomes of interest for this review. None of the included studies reported primary outcomes prespecified in the review protocol (blood loss of 1000 mL or more over the period of observation, maternal death or severe morbidity). Overall, there was no clear evidence of differences between groups in the following PPH outcomes: blood loss of 500 mL or more (risk ratio (RR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.39 to 5.47, two studies), amount of lochia during the first 72 hours of the puerperium (mean difference (MD) -25.00 g; 95% CI -69.79 to 19.79, one study), or amount of lochia by four weeks postpartum (MD -7.00 g; 95% CI -23.99 to 9.99). The Japanese study with a relatively small sample size comparing oral methylergometrine with a Japanese traditional herbal medicine found that oral methylergometrine significantly increased the blood haemoglobin concentration at day one postpartum (MD 0.50 g/dL; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.89) compared to herbal medicine. Adverse events were not well-reported in the included studies. We did not find any studies comparing homeopathic remedies with either a placebo or no treatment. There was insufficient evidence to support the use of prophylactic oral methylergometrine given after delivery of the placenta for the prevention of PPH. Additionally, the effectiveness of prophylactic use of herbal medicine or homeopathic remedies for PPH is still unclear as we could not find any clear evidence. Trials to assess the effectiveness of herbal medicines and homeopathic remedies in preventing PPH are warranted.","We found a total of five randomised clinical trials (involving 1466 women). In three of the trials (involving 1268 women), oral methylergometrine was compared with placebo (two trials) or the Japanese traditional herbal medicine Kyuki-chouketsu-in (one trial). The other two trials (involving 198 women) did not report information on relevant outcomes of interest for this review. The trials were not of good quality and adverse events were not well-reported. We did not find any completed trials looking at the effectiveness of homeopathic remedies in reducing haemorrhage after childbirth. Overall, there was no clear evidence that prophylactic oral methylergometrine was effective in reducing haemorrhage after childbirth. The effectiveness of such remedies warrants further investigation."
CD008986,"In this updated review, we included a total of 25 trials (15,076 participants), of which 15 were new trials (11,501 participants). Follow-up ranged from 1 to 20 months. We found that medication reviews in hospitalised adults may have little to no effect on mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.05; 18 trials, 10,108 participants; low-certainty evidence); likely reduce hospital readmissions (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98; 17 trials, 9561 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); may reduce emergency department contacts (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.03; 8 trials, 3527 participants; low-certainty evidence) and have very uncertain effects on health-related quality of life (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.30; 4 trials, 392 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Medication reviews in hospitalised adult patients likely reduce hospital readmissions and may reduce emergency department contacts. The evidence suggests that mediation reviews may have little to no effect on mortality, while the effect on health-related quality of life is very uncertain. Almost all trials included elderly polypharmacy patients, which limits the generalisability of the results beyond this population.","We searched for trials that examined medication reviews compared with usual care or trials that examined two or more types of medication reviews in hospitalised adults. We found that medication reviews in hospitalised adult patients likely reduce hospital readmissions and may reduce emergency department contacts. However, medication reviews may have little to no effect on mortality, and it is unclear if medication reviews have an effect on health-related quality of life. Almost all trials included elderly patients taking a high number of medications, so we may not be able to generalise the results to other types of patients."
CD005001,"For this 2015 update we included a total of 32 studies with 2626 randomised women, 8 studies from the original search and 24 studies from the updated search. We found evidence that physical exercise during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer probably improves physical fitness (SMD 0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.59; 15 studies; 1310 women; moderate-quality evidence) and slightly reduces fatigue (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.16; 19 studies; 1698 women; moderate-quality evidence). Exercise may lead to little or no improvement in health-related quality of life (MD 1.10, 95% CI -5.28 to 7.48; 1 study; 68 women; low-quality evidence), a slight improvement in cancer site-specific quality of life (MD 4.24, 95% CI -1.81 to 10.29; 4 studies; 262 women; low-quality evidence), and an improvement in cognitive function (MD -11.55, 95% CI -22.06 to -1.05; 2 studies; 213 women; low-quality evidence). Exercise probably leads to little or no difference in cancer-specific quality of life (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.25; 12 studies; 1012 women; moderate-quality evidence) and little or no difference in depression (SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.30 to 0.01; 5 studies; 674 women; moderate-quality evidence). Evidence for other outcomes ranged from low to moderate quality. Seven trials reported a very small number of adverse events. Exercise during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer can be regarded as a supportive self care intervention that probably results in less fatigue, improved physical fitness, and little or no difference in cancer-specific quality of life and depression. Exercise may also slightly improve cancer site-specific quality of life and cognitive function, while it may result in little or no difference in health-related quality of life. This review is based on trials with a considerable degree of clinical heterogeneity regarding adjuvant cancer treatments and exercise interventions. Due to the difficulty of blinding exercise trials, all included trials were at high risk for performance bias. Furthermore, the majority of trials were at high risk for detection bias, largely due to most outcomes being self reported. The findings of the updated review have enabled us to make a more precise conclusion that both aerobic and resistance exercise can be regarded as beneficial for individuals with adjuvant therapy-related side effects. Further research is required to determine the optimal type, intensity, and timing of an exercise intervention. Furthermore, long-term evaluation is required due to possible long-term side effects of adjuvant treatment.","32 studies involving 2626 women. Combining the results of these studies suggests that physical exercise probably improves physical fitness and slightly lessens fatigue. Exercise may improve mental function and slightly improve cancer site-specific quality of life, although the quality of the evidence was low for both of these outcomes. It may result in little or no improvement in health-related quality of life, however the quality of evidence was low for this outcome. These studies also suggest that physical exercise probably results in little or no improvement in cancer-specific quality of life and depression. The quality of evidence may have been low because many of the studies did not have enough participants to observe small differences and because results may be biased due to people assessing the outcomes knowing which participants were in the control group. It appears that exercise during cancer treatment can help lessen fatigue and improve physical fitness. It probably results in little or no improvement in cancer-specific quality of life and depression."
CD001777,"We identified 12 trials most of which are of moderate risk of bias involving 7,119 participants which described random assignment. Five trials randomised to either immediate or delayed insertion of IUD. One of them randomised to immediate versus delayed insertion of Copper 7 showed immediate insertion of the Copper 7 was associated with a higher risk of expulsion than was delayed insertion (RR 11.98, 95% CI 1.61 to 89.35,1 study, 259 participants); the quality of evidence was moderate. Moderate quality of evidence also suggests that use and expulsion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system or CuT380A was more likely for immediate compared to delayed insertion risk ratio (RR) 1.40 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.58; 3 studies; 878 participants) and RR 2.64 ( 95% CI 1.16 to 6.00; 3 studies; 878 participants) respectively. Another trial randomised to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T showed discontinuation rates due to pregnancy were likely to be higher for women in the Nova T group. (MD 8.70, 95% CI 3.92 to 13.48;1 study; 438 participants); moderate quality evidence. Seven trials examined immediate insertion of IUD only. From meta-analysis of two multicentre trials, pregnancy was less likely for the TCu 220C versus the Lippes Loop (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.75; 2 studies; 2257 participants ) as was expulsion (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.81; 2 studies; 2257 participants). Estimates for the TCu 220 versus the Copper 7 were RR 0.42 ( 95% CI 0.23 to 0.77; 2 studies, 2,274 participants) and RR 0.68, (95% CI 0.51 to 0.91); 2 studies, 2,274 participants), respectively. In other work, adding copper sleeves to the Lippes Loop improved efficacy (RR 3.40, 95% CI 1.28 to 9.04, 1 study, 400 participants) and reduced expulsion (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.51 to 5.97; 1 study, 400 participants). Moderate quality evidence shows that insertion of an IUD immediately after abortion is safe and practical. IUD expulsion rates appear higher immediately after abortions compared to delayed insertions. However, at six months postabortion, IUD use is higher following immediate insertion compared to delayed insertion.","We found 12 studies to include. Four trials randomised women to an IUD inserted right away or at a later time. Three recent trials (of levonorgestrel intrauterine system or CuT380A) showed use was greater at six months for an IUD inserted right away compared to one inserted later. Another trial assigned women to the levonorgestrel IUD or Nova T; more women with the Nova T stopped use due to pregnancy. Seven trials looked at inserting the IUD right away. From two large trials, the TCu 220C was better than the Lippes Loop and the Copper 7 for preventing pregnancy and staying in. In other work, when the Lippes Loop had copper arms added, fewer women got pregnant and the IUD stayed in more often. Moderate level evidence shows that inserting an IUD right after an abortion or miscarriage is safe and practical. Women are more likely to use an IUD at six months if they had it inserted right away compared to some weeks after the abortion or miscarriage."
CD011389,"In total, 2794 participants were randomised in 13 trials included in this review. All the trials were at unclear or high risk of bias. One trial (which included 53 participants) did not contribute any data to this review. A total of 213 participants were excluded in the remaining trials after randomisation, leaving a total of 2528 randomised participants for analysis, with 1288 undergoing laparoscopic gastrectomy and 1240 undergoing open gastrectomy. All the participants were suitable for major surgery. There was no difference in the proportion of participants who died within thirty days of treatment between laparoscopic gastrectomy (7/1188: adjusted proportion = 0.6% (based on meta-analysis)) and open gastrectomy (4/1447: 0.3%) (RR 1.60, 95% CI 0.50 to 5.10; risk difference 0.00, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.01; participants = 2335; studies = 11; I2 = 0%; low quality evidence). There were no events in either group for short-term recurrence (participants = 103; studies = 3), proportion requiring blood transfusion (participants = 66; studies = 2), and proportion with positive margins at histopathology (participants = 28; studies = 1). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, time to return to normal activity or time to return to work. The differences in long-term mortality (HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.25; participants = 195; studies = 3; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence), serious adverse events within three months (laparoscopic gastrectomy (7/216: adjusted proportion = 3.6%) versus open gastrectomy (13/216: 6%) (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.34; participants = 432; studies = 8; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence), long-term recurrence (HR 0.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.30; participants = 162; studies = 4; very low quality evidence), adverse events within three months (laparoscopic gastrectomy (204/268: adjusted proportion = 16.1%) versus open gastrectomy (253/1222: 20.7%) (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.01; participants = 2490; studies = 11; I2 = 38%; very low quality evidence), quantity of perioperative blood transfused (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.27 to 0.38; participants = 143; studies = 2; I2 = 0%; very low quality evidence), length of hospital stay (MD -1.82 days, 95% CI -3.72 to 0.07; participants = 319; studies = 6; I2 = 83%; very low quality evidence), and number of lymph nodes harvested (MD -0.63, 95% CI -1.51 to 0.25; participants = 472; studies = 9; I2 = 40%; very low quality evidence) were imprecise. There was no alteration in the interpretation of the results in any of the subgroups. Based on low quality evidence, there is no difference in short-term mortality between laparoscopic and open gastrectomy. Based on very low quality evidence, there is no evidence for any differences in short-term or long-term outcomes between laparoscopic and open gastrectomy. However, the data are sparse, and the confidence intervals were wide, suggesting that significant benefits or harms of laparoscopic gastrectomy cannot be ruled out. Several trials are currently being conducted and interim results of these trials have been included in this review. These trials need to perform intention-to-treat analysis to ensure that the results are reliable and report the results according to the CONSORT Statement.","We identified 13 eligible studies (2794 participants) for this review. One trial did not report any information that we sought. Information on 213 participants was not reported because of various reasons, the common reason being that they did not receive the planned treatment. A total of 2528 participants received either laparoscopic gastrectomy (1288 participants) or open gastrectomy (1240 participants). The decision on whether a participant received laparoscopic or open gastrectomy was made using methods similar to the toss of a coin. All the participants were suitable for major surgery. There was no difference between laparoscopic and open gastrectomy in short-term deaths (laparoscopic gastrectomy: 6 deaths in 1000 operations versus open gastrectomy: 3 deaths in 1000 operations). None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, time to return to normal activity or time to return to work. The differences in long-term deaths, serious complications within three months (laparoscopic gastrectomy: 36 complications per 1000 operations versus open gastrectomy: 60 complications per 1000 operations), all complications within three months (laparoscopic gastrectomy: 161 complications per 1000 operations versus open gastrectomy: 253 complications in 1000 operations, short-term and long-term recurrence of cancer, number of people who required blood transfusion, amount of blood transfused during or within one week of surgery, and length of hospital stay were imprecise. Because of this uncertainty, we were able to conclude that there was no difference in short-term deaths between the groups, although the deaths in laparoscopic gastrectomy was twice that in open gastrectomy. The quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes, apart from short-term mortality, which was low. As a result, significant benefits or harms of laparoscopic gastrectomy compared to open gastrectomy cannot be ruled out. Further well designed trials are necessary to compare the benefits and harms of laparoscopic and open gastrectomy."
CD011010,"We included eight studies (654 participants) in this review. Six of these studies (625 participants) contributed data to our primary analyses. Four studies contributed to our comparison of high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) oxygen therapy versus continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for respiratory support in term infants. The outcome of death was reported in two studies (439 infants) but there were no events in either group. HFNC may have little to no effect on treatment failure, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.47 to 2.04; 3 trials, 452 infants; very low-certainty evidence). The outcome of chronic lung disease (need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life) was reported in one study (375 participants) but there were no events in either group. HFNC may have little to no effect on the duration of respiratory support (any form of non-invasive respiratory support with or without supplemental oxygen), but the evidence is very uncertain (MD 0.17 days, 95% CI -0.28 to 0.61; 4 trials, 530 infants; very low-certainty evidence). HFNC likely results in little to no difference in the length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU) (MD 0.90 days, 95% CI -0.31 to 2.12; 3 trials, 452 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). HFNC may reduce the incidence of nasal trauma (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.66; 1 trial, 78 infants; very low-certainty evidence) and abdominal overdistension (RR 0.22, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.71; 1 trial, 78 infants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Two studies contributed to our analysis of HFNC versus low flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (LFNC) (supplemental oxygen up to a maximum flow rate of 2 L/min). The outcome of death was reported in both studies (95 infants) but there were no events in either group. The evidence suggests that HFNC may reduce treatment failure slightly (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.92; 2 trials, 95 infants; low-certainty evidence). Neither study reported results for the outcome of chronic lung disease (need for supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life). HFNC may have little to no effect on the duration of respiratory support (MD -0.07 days, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.69; 1 trial, 74 infants; very low-certainty evidence), length of stay at the ICU (MD 0.49 days, 95% CI -0.83 to 1.81; 1 trial, 74 infants; very low-certainty evidence), or hospital length of stay (MD -0.60 days, 95% CI -2.07 to 0.86; 2 trials, 95 infants; very low-certainty evidence), but the evidence is very uncertain. Adverse events was an outcome reported in both studies (95 infants) but there were no events in either group. The risk of bias across outcomes was generally low, although there were some concerns of bias. The certainty of evidence across outcomes ranged from moderate to very low, downgraded due to risk of bias, imprecision, indirectness, and inconsistency. When compared with CPAP, HFNC may result in little to no difference in treatment failure. HFNC may have little to no effect on the duration of respiratory support, but the evidence is very uncertain. HFNC likely results in little to no difference in the length of stay at the intensive care unit. HFNC may reduce the incidence of nasal trauma and abdominal overdistension, but the evidence is very uncertain. When compared with LFNC, HFNC may reduce treatment failure slightly. HFNC may have little to no effect on the duration of respiratory support, length of stay at the ICU, or hospital length of stay, but the evidence is very uncertain. There is insufficient evidence to enable the formulation of evidence-based guidelines on the use of HFNC for respiratory support in term infants. Larger, methodologically robust trials are required to further evaluate the possible health benefits or harms of HFNC in this patient population.","In a search conducted to December 2022, we identified eight studies that investigated HFNC therapy across a total of 654 term infants. Six of these studies (625 participants) contributed data to our primary analysis. Four of the studies compared HFNC with an alternative method of non-invasive support known as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) (where air is pressurised by a machine to a constant pressure and delivered into the airway via a mask placed over the face/mouth or tubes positioned just inside the nostrils). Two studies compared HFNC with low flow nasal cannula (LFNC) (oxygen therapy up to a maximum gas flow rate of 2 L/min). HFNC may have little to no effect on treatment failure, but the evidence is very uncertain. One study investigated chronic lung disease (the need for oxygen support at 28 days of life) but no infants in the study met these criteria. HFNC may have little to no effect on the duration of respiratory support (length of time infants receive any form of extra breathing support with or without the addition of oxygen), but the evidence is very uncertain. HFNC likely results in little to no difference in the length of stay at the intensive care unit (ICU). HFNC may reduce the incidence of nasal trauma (damage to the nasal tissue) and abdominal overdistension (where air accumulates in the abdomen and causes excessive expansion), but the evidence is very uncertain. The evidence suggests HFNC may reduce treatment failure slightly. Neither study investigated chronic lung disease. HFNC may have little to no effect on the duration of respiratory support, length of stay at the ICU, or hospital length of stay, but the evidence is very uncertain. Both studies recorded zero adverse events. Our confidence in the evidence is moderate to very low. When compared with CPAP, HFNC may result in little to no difference in treatment failure. HFNC may have little to no effect on the duration of respiratory support, but the evidence is very uncertain.

CD008681,"We included seven trials involving 800 women. The comparisons revealed a very high clinical heterogeneity. As a result of the heterogeneity in the randomisation unit, we did not combine trials but reported the individual trial results in the ‘Data and analysis’ section and in the text. Half of trials have unclear or high risk of bias in several domains. We did not find any trial reporting data about maternal mortality. In terms of postoperative pain, PCB does not improve the control of postoperative pain when it is compared against sedation/analgesia or versus no anaesthesia/no analgesia. In the comparison of PCB with lidocaine versus PCB with saline solution, significant differences favouring the group with lidocaine were found in one trial (moderate or severe postoperative pain) (risk ratio (RR) 0.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.18 to 0.59). When opioids were used, postoperative nausea and vomiting was more frequent in two trials comparing those versus PCB. In terms of requirement of blood transfusion, two trials showed conflicting results. Particular considerations that influence the choice of anaesthesia for this procedure such as availability, effectiveness, safety, side effects, practitioner's choice, costs and woman's preferences of each technique should continue to be used until more evidence supporting the use of one technique or another.","We included seven trials involving 800 women. We did not combine the results of the trials because the trials were very different in the clinical interventions used and how the outcomes were assessed. None of the included studies reported any maternal mortality. Paracervical block did not improve the control of postoperative pain when compared against sedation and analgesia. More nausea and vomiting were reported when opioid drugs were used. Key factors that influence the choice of anaesthesia include availability, effectiveness, safety, side effects, and costs."
CD009310,"We screened a total of 566 records. Seven RCTs involving 486 patients were identified, but we could only meta-analyse the two evaluating GM-CSF. We judged the potential risk of bias of these trials as unclear, mostly due to missing information. All trials were randomised and open-label studies. However, three trials were published as abstracts only, therefore we were not able to assess the potential risk of bias for these trials in detail. Overall, data were not reported in a comparable way and patient-related outcomes like survival, time to progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or the incidence of infections was reported in two trials only. Five RCTs (N = 337) assessed the efficacy of G-CSF in combination with standard therapy (supportive care, chemotherapy or erythropoietin). We were not able to perform meta-analyses for any of the pre-planned outcomes due to inconsistent and insufficient reporting of data. There is no evidence for a difference for overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44 to 1.47), progression-free survival (only P value provided), progression to AML, incidence of infections and number of red blood transfusions (average number of 12 red blood cell transfusions in each arm). We judged the quality of evidence for all these outcomes as very low, due to very high imprecision and potential publication bias, as three trials were published as abstracts only. Data about quality of life and serious adverse events were not reported in any of the included trials. Two RCTs (N = 149) evaluated GM-CSF in addition to standard therapy (chemotherapy). For mortality (two RCTs; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.26), we found no evidence for a difference (low-quality evidence). Data for progression-free survival and serious adverse events were not comparable across both studies, without evidence for a difference between both arms (low-quality evidence). For infections, red blood cell and platelet transfusions, we found no evidence for a difference, however, these outcomes were reported by one trial only (low-quality evidence). Time to progression to AML and quality of life were not reported at all. Moreover, we identified two cross-over trials, including 244 patients and evaluating GM-CSF versus placebo, without publishing results for each arm before crossing over. In addition, we identified two ongoing studies, one of which was discontinued due to withdrawal of pharmaceutical support, the other was terminated early, both without publishing results. Although we identified seven trials with a total number of 486 patients, and two unpublished, prematurely finished studies, this systematic review mainly shows that there is a substantial lack of data, which might inform the use of G-CSF and GM-CSF for the prevention of infections, prolonging of survival and improvement of quality of life. The impact on progression to AML remains unclear.","Our review included seven trials investigating the effect of G-CSF or GM-CSF in a randomised design. Five trials evaluated G-CSF in addition to standard care (N = 337). A meta-analysis of outcomes from this comparison was not conducted, since results were provided in an incomparable and insufficient way across these trials. There was no evidence for a difference between ""additional G-CSF"" and ""standard care only"" in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival, time to progression to AML, infections, and incidence of blood product transfusions. Quality of evidence for all the G-CSF analyses is very low, due to very high imprecision and potential publication bias (three trials have not been reported as full-text, although they were published as abstracts several years ago). The quality of the evidence for all GM-CSF analyses was graded as low, due to very high imprecision. Quality of life and serious adverse events were not reported at all. Two trials assessed GM-CSF in addition to standard care only (N = 149). In summary, we found no evidence for a difference in terms of overall survival, progression-free survival, infection occurrence, quality of life, time to progression to AML, incidence of blood transfusions and adverse events (e.g. infection, bleeding, nausea) for both of the growth factors. Time to progression to acute leukaemia and quality of life were not reported at all. In addition, we identified two trials evaluating 244 patients without publishing results for each trial arm before all patients could receive GM-CSF (cross-over design). Moreover, we identified two trials, of which both have been terminated early, without publishing any results in both cases. Although we identified seven trials with a total number of 486 patients, two cross-over trials and two unpublished, prematurely finished studies, this systematic review mainly shows that there is a substantial lack of data, which might rectify the use of G-CSF and GM-CSF for the prevention of infections, prolonging of survival or improvement of quality of life."
CD004194,"We included 46 randomized studies, 40 on vasovagal syncope and six on carotid sinus syncope. No studies on situational syncope matched the criteria for inclusion in our review. Studies in general were small with a median sample size of 42. A wide range of control treatments were used with 22 studies using a placebo arm. Blinding of patients and treating physicians was applied in eight studies. Results varied considerably between studies and between types of outcomes. For vasovagal syncope, the occurrence of syncope upon provocational head-up tilt testing was lower upon treatment with beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitors and anticholinergic agents compared to standard treatment. For carotid sinus syncope, the occurrence of syncope upon carotid sinus massage was lower on midodrine treatment compared to placebo treatment in one study. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of any of the pharmacological or pacemaker treatments for vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope. Larger studies using patient relevant outcomes are needed.","We included 46 randomized studies, 40 on vasovagal syncope and six on carotid sinus syncope.

A wide range of control treatments were used with 22 studies using placebo control treatment. Blinding of patients and treating physicians was applied in eight studies. The type of outcomes reported by studies varied considerably with only 16 studies reporting on non-provoked recurrences during follow-up. As a consequence of all these differences, results varied considerably between studies and between types of outcomes. In some studies significant results were reported for one type of outcome, but not for other outcomes. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence either to support or to refute the use of any of the pharmacological or pacemaker treatments for vasovagal syncope and carotid sinus syncope."
CD002261,"Four randomised controlled trials have compared pramipexole with placebo in 669 patients with later Parkinson's disease. Two phase III studies were medium term (24 weeks maintenance period) and 2 phase II studies were short term (4 weeks maintenance period). The reduction in off time was significantly greater with pramipexole compared with placebo (weighted mean difference 1.8 hours; 1.2, 2.3 95% CI). No significant changes were noted in a dyskinesia rating scale in any of the 4 studies, but dyskinesia as an adverse event was reported more frequently with pramipexole. A significant improvement occurred in UPDRS complication score (part IV) in 2 studies but not in the remaining trials. Statistically significant improvements in UPDRS ADL score occurred with pramipexole in all studies. Significant improvements in UPDRS motor scores in the on state were reported in 3 of the 4 studies. Levodopa dose reduction was allowed in 3 studies and meta-analysis shows a significant difference in favour of pramipexole (weighted mean difference 115 mg; 87, 143 95% CI). Trends toward a higher incidence of dopaminergic adverse events with pramipexole only reached statistical significance regarding hallucinations. There were significantly fewer withdrawals from pramipexole. Pramipexole can be used to reduce off time, improve motor impairments and disability and reduce levodopa dose at the expense of increased dyskinetic adverse events. This conclusion is based on short and medium term trials (up to 24 weeks). Further trials are required to directly compare the newer with the older dopamine agonists.","Four trials have compared pramipexole with placebo in 669 patients with later Parkinson's disease.

CD007632,"Ten trials including 657 patients compared different methods of vascular occlusion. All trials were of high risk of bias. Only one or two trials were included under each comparison. There was no statistically significant differences in mortality, liver failure, or other morbidity between any of the comparisons. Hepatic vascular occlusion does not decrease the blood transfusion requirements. It decreases the cardiac output and increases the systemic vascular resistance. In the comparison between continuous portal triad clamping and intermittent portal triad clamping, four of the five liver failures occurred in patients with chronic liver diseases undergoing the liver resections using continuous portal triad clamping. In the comparison between selective inflow occlusion and portal triad clamping, all four patients with liver failure occurred in the selective inflow occlusion group. There was no difference in any of the other important outcomes in any of the comparisons. In elective liver resection, hepatic vascular occlusion cannot be recommended over portal triad clamping. Intermittent portal triad clamping seems to be better than continuous portal triad clamping at least in patients with chronic liver disease. There is no evidence to support selective inflow occlusion over portal triad clamping. The optimal method of intermittent portal triad clamping is not clear. There is no evidence for any difference between the ischaemic preconditioning followed by vascular occlusion and intermittent vascular occlusion for liver resection in patients with non-cirrhotic livers. Further randomised trials of low risk of bias are needed to determine the optimal technique of vascular occlusion.","Ten trials including 657 patients were included in this review. All were of high risk of bias (systematic error) and play of chance (random error). Only one or two trials were included under each comparison. There was no difference in mortality, liver failure, or post-operative complications between any of the comparisons. Hepatic vascular occlusion does not decrease the blood transfusion requirements. It decreases the cardiac output (amount of blood pumped by the heart in one second) and increases the systemic vascular resistance (resistance to the flow of blood in the vessels), which may have potential problems in patients with heart disorders. Although there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of liver failure between continuous portal triad clamping and intermittent portal triad clamping (5/60; 8.5% versus 0/61), most of them occurred in patients with chronic liver diseases undergoing the liver resections using continuous portal triad clamping. There was no benefit in selective inflow occlusion compared to portal triad clamping. There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of liver failure between the two groups (4/41; 9.8% versus 0/39), but all patients with liver failure occurred in the selective inflow occlusion group.

CD001027,"Fifteen studies (1043 CFS participants) were included in the review. When comparing CBT with usual care (six studies, 373 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment was highly significant in favour of CBT (SMD -0.39, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.19), with 40% of CBT participants (four studies, 371 participants) showing clinical response in contrast with 26% in usual care (OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.76). Findings at follow-up were inconsistent. For CBT versus other psychological therapies, comprising relaxation, counselling and education/support (four studies, 313 participants), the difference in fatigue mean scores at post-treatment favoured CBT (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.65 to -0.20). Findings at follow-up were heterogeneous and inconsistent. Only two studies compared CBT against other interventions and one study compared CBT in combination with other interventions against usual care. CBT is effective in reducing the symptoms of fatigue at post-treatment compared with usual care, and may be more effective in reducing fatigue symptoms compared with other psychological therapies. The evidence base at follow-up is limited to a small group of studies with inconsistent findings. There is a lack of evidence on the comparative effectiveness of CBT alone or in combination with other treatments, and further studies are required to inform the development of effective treatment programmes for people with CFS.","The review included 15 studies, with a total of 1043 CFS participants. The review showed that people attending for CBT were more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than people who received usual care or were on a waiting list for therapy, with 40% of people in the CBT group showing clinical improvement, in contrast with 26% in usual care. At follow-up, 1-7 months after treatment ended, people who had completed their course of CBT continued to have lower fatigue levels, but when including people who had dropped out of treatment, there was no difference between CBT and usual care. The review also compared CBT against other types of psychological therapy, including relaxation techniques, counselling and support/education, and found that people attending for CBT was more likely to have reduced fatigue symptoms at the end of treatment than those attending for other psychological therapies. However at follow-up, the results were inconsistent and the studies did not fit well together, making it difficult to draw any conclusions. Only two studies compared the effectiveness of CBT against other treatments, both exercise therapy, and just one study compared a combination of CBT and other treatments with usual care. More studies should be carried out to establish whether CBT is more helpful than other treatments for CFS, and whether CBT in combination with other treatments is more helpful than single treatment approaches."
CD006437,"We included eight randomised studies encompassing 850 participants. Five studies compared titanium clips versus ligature, two studies compared an endoscopic stapler device versus ligature, and one study compared an endoscopic stapler device, titanium clips, and ligature. In our analyses of primary outcomes, we found no differences in total complications (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.27 to 3.50, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence), intraoperative complications (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.34 to 2.55, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence), or postoperative complications (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.21 to 3.13, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence) between ligature and all types of mechanical devices. However, our analyses of secondary outcomes revealed that use of mechanical devices saved approximately nine minutes of total operating time when compared with use of a ligature (mean difference (MD) -9.04 minutes, 95% CI -12.97 to -5.11 minutes, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence). However, this finding did not translate into a clinically or statistically significant reduction in inpatient hospital stay (MD 0.02 days, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.17 days, 8 RCTs, very low-quality evidence). Available information was insufficient for reliable comparison of total hospital costs and postoperative pain/quality of life between the two approaches. Overall, evidence across all analyses was of very low quality, with substantial potential for confounding factors. Given the limitations of all studies in terms of bias and the low quality of available evidence, a clear conclusion regarding superiority of any one particular type of mechanical device over another is not possible. Evidence is insufficient at present to advocate omission of conventional ligature-based appendix stump closure in favour of any single type of mechanical device over another in uncomplicated appendicitis.","This systematic review included eight randomised controlled trials involving a total of 850 participants. All trials compared mechanical devices versus ligatures for appendix stump closure. Five of the eight trials compared use of clips versus ligature, two trials compared an automated stapler versus ligature, and one trial compared all three methods. However, mechanical devices did make the operation nine minutes quicker when compared with ligatures. We did not have enough information to reliably evaluate hospital costs, pain, or quality of life for either of these comparisons. The evidence used to derive our conclusions was generally of low quality. As a result, we have not found enough evidence at present that would lead us to strongly recommend any particular method over another."
CD013792,"Our meta-analysis included seven randomised trials involving 5,682 women, and all provided data for meta-analysis. All trials were conducted in hospital settings. Across seven trials (14 treatment arms), the following treatments were used: three arms (21%) used vaginal micronized progesterone; three arms (21%) used dydrogesterone; one arm (7%) used oral micronized progesterone; one arm (7%) used 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone, and six arms (43%) used placebo. Women with threatened miscarriage
Based on the relative effects from the pairwise meta-analysis, vaginal micronized progesterone (two trials, 4090 women, risk ratio (RR) 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00 to 1.07, high-certainty evidence), and dydrogesterone (one trial, 406 women, RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07, moderate-certainty evidence) probably make little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with threatened miscarriage. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with threatened miscarriage. The pre-specified subgroup analysis by number of previous miscarriages is only possible for vaginal micronized progesterone in women with threatened miscarriage. In women with no previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, there is probably little or no improvement in the live birth rate (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.04, high-certainty evidence) when treated with vaginal micronized progesterone compared to placebo. However, for women with one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, vaginal micronized progesterone increases the live birth rate compared to placebo (RR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15, high-certainty evidence). Women with recurrent miscarriage
Based on the results from one trial (826 women) vaginal micronized progesterone (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.15, high-certainty evidence) probably makes little or no difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low-certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. Additional outcomes
All progestogen treatments have a wide range of effects on the other pre-specified outcomes (miscarriage (< 24 weeks of gestation), preterm birth (< 37 weeks of gestation), stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy) in comparison to placebo for both threatened and recurrent miscarriage. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence with a wide range of effects suggests that there is probably no difference in congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events with vaginal micronized progesterone for threatened (congenital abnormalities RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.46, moderate-certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.07 95% CI 0.81 to 1.39, moderate-certainty evidence) or recurrent miscarriage (congenital abnormalities 0.75, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.85, low-certainty evidence; adverse drug events RR 1.46, 95% CI 0.93 to 2.29, moderate-certainty evidence) compared with placebo. There are limited data and very low-certainty evidence on congenital abnormalities and adverse drug events for the other progestogens. The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. However, vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women with a history of one or more previous miscarriages and early pregnancy bleeding, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage.","We searched for evidence in December 2020 and identified seven studies involving 5,682 women. All women were managed in hospitals. Four different progestogen treatments were used: vaginal micronized progesterone, oral dydrogesterone, oral micronized progesterone and 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone injected into muscle. We further studied the women who had experienced a previous miscarriage, were now presenting with a threatened miscarriage, and were given vaginal micronized progesterone or placebo. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone (high-quality evidence) and oral dydrogesterone (moderate-quality evidence) made little difference to the number of women who went on to have a live birth when compared with placebo. For women with one or more previous miscarriages, vaginal micronized progesterone increased the live birth rate compared to placebo (high-quality evidence). Those women who had no previous miscarriages, but were now presenting with early pregnancy bleeding showed no improvement in live birth rate (high-certainty evidence). For women with recurrent miscarriage, we based our findings on one study involving 826 women. Overall, vaginal micronized progesterone made little difference to the live birth rate when compared with placebo. The evidence for dydrogesterone compared with placebo for women with recurrent miscarriage is of very low-certainty evidence, therefore the effects remain unclear. No data are available to assess the effectiveness of 17-α-hydroxyprogesterone or oral micronized progesterone for the outcome of live birth in women with recurrent miscarriage. The overall available evidence suggests that progestogens probably make little or no difference to live birth rate for women with threatened or recurrent miscarriage. Vaginal micronized progesterone may increase the live birth rate for women who are experiencing early pregnancy bleeding and have a history of one or more previous miscarriages, with likely no difference in adverse events. There is still uncertainty over the effectiveness and safety of alternative progestogen treatments for threatened and recurrent miscarriage."
CD006614,"We included one trial in which participants were randomised to receive either betamethasone or usual care. The trial included 942 women and 942 neonates recruited from 10 UK hospitals between 1995 and 2002. This review includes only trials that met predefined criteria for trustworthiness. We removed three trials from the analysis that were included in the previous version of this review. The risk of bias was low for random sequence generation, allocation concealment and incomplete outcome data. The risk of bias for selective outcome reporting was unclear because there was no published trial protocol, and therefore it is unclear whether all the planned outcomes were reported in full. Due to a lack of blinding we judged there to be high risk of performance bias and detection bias. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of concerns about risk of bias and because of imprecision due to low event rates and wide 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which are consistent with possible benefit and possible harm
Compared with usual care, it is uncertain if antenatal corticosteroids reduce the risk of RDS (relative risk (RR) 0.34 95% CI 0.07 to 1.65; 1 study; 942 infants) or TTN (RR 0.52, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.11; 1 study; 938 infants) because the certainty of evidence is low and the 95% CIs are consistent with possible benefit and possible harm. Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of admission to neonatal special care for respiratory complications, compared with usual care (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.90; 1 study; 942 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). The proportion of infants admitted to neonatal special care for respiratory morbidity after treatment with antenatal corticosteroids was 2.3% compared with 5.1% in the usual care group. It is uncertain if antenatal steroids have any effect on the risk of needing mechanical ventilation, compared with usual care (RR 4.07, 95% CI 0.46 to 36.27; 1 study; 942 infants; very low-certainty evidence). The effect of antenatal corticosteroids on the maternal development of postpartum infection/pyrexia in the first 72 hours is unclear due to the very low certainty of the evidence; one study (942 women) reported zero cases. The included studies did not report any data for neonatal hypoglycaemia or maternal mortality/severe morbidity. Evidence from one randomised controlled trial suggests that prophylactic corticosteroids before elective caesarean section at term probably reduces admission to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory morbidity. It is uncertain if administration of antenatal corticosteroids reduces the rates of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or transient tachypnoea of the neonate (TTN). The overall certainty of the evidence for the primary outcomes was found to be low or very low, apart from the outcome of admission to neonatal special care (all levels) for respiratory morbidity, for which the evidence was of moderate certainty. Therefore, there is currently insufficient data to draw any firm conclusions. More evidence is needed to investigate the effect of prophylactic antenatal corticosteroids on the incidence of recognised respiratory morbidity such as RDS. Any future trials should assess the balance between respiratory benefit and potential immediate adverse effects (e.g. hypoglycaemia) and long-term adverse effects (e.g. academic performance) for the infant. There is very limited information on maternal health outcomes to provide any assurances that corticosteroids do not pose any increased risk of harm to the mother. Further research should consider investigating the effectiveness of antenatal steroids at different gestational ages prior to caesarean section. There are nine potentially eligible studies that are currently ongoing and could be included in future updates of this review.","We searched the medical literature for randomised controlled studies that met our criteria for being trustworthy and compared the effects of corticosteroids against a placebo (dummy) treatment or against usual care. We included one trial that involved 942 women and 942 babies recruited from 10 UK hospitals. It is uncertain if corticosteroids reduce the risk of transient tachypnoea of the neonate (a mild breathing problem) or respiratory distress syndrome (i.e serious breathing problems) compared with usual care. Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of admission to neonatal special care for breathing complications compared with usual care. The risk of being admitted to neonatal special care because of breathing problems was reduced in one study. It is uncertain if corticosteroids have any effect on the risk of the baby needing additional breathing support (mechanical ventilation) compared with usual care. It is uncertain if antenatal corticosteroids have any effect on women developing infection or high temperature within 72 hours of giving birth (there were no cases in the one study involving 942 women). It is uncertain if corticosteroids have any effect on the risk of serious breathing problems (respiratory distress syndrome) or rapid breathing (transient tachypnoea) in the neonate, compared with usual care. The certainty of evidence from the included randomised trial was very low to moderate. Further studies are needed to investigate if antenatal corticosteroids do reduce the risk of serious respiratory problems (such as respiratory distress syndrome). Future trials need to make sure they assess for possible short- and long-term harm to both mother and baby after receiving a course of antenatal corticosteroids prior to caesarean section at term. Further research could consider assessing whether any benefits or harms identified by giving a course of antenatal corticosteroids are affected by the gestational age at which the planned caesarean is performed. There are nine potentially eligible studies that are currently ongoing and could be included in future updates of this review."
CD010422,"Only one study evaluating lamotrigine in secondary progressive MS was eligible. One hundred and twenty people were included, 61 randomly assigned to lamotrigine treatment and 59 to placebo treatment. The average age of participants in the two groups was 51.9 years and 50.1 years, respectively. The proportion of male participants was 27.5%. The period of follow-up was 2 years. No data were found on disability progression and people who experienced relapses. No significant differences were found for serious adverse events between the two groups. Treatment with lamotrigine was associated with more rashes (20% vs 5%, P value 0.03) and transient, dose-related deterioration of mobility (66% vs 34%, P value 0.001) than placebo. Furthermore, no significant difference between the two groups was found in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of cerebral atrophy, Expanded Disability Status Score changes, Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite score changes. This study was judged to be at high risk of bias. This review will be updated when the three ongoing studies we identified are completed. The quality of evidence was judged to be very low due to the low number of available studies and included participants. There is a lack of evidence to address the review question on the efficacy of sodium channel blockers for people with MS. Assessment of the three ongoing trials might change this conclusion. Further high-quality large scale studies are needed.","No data were found on disability progression and people who experienced relapses.

CD009422,"Four studies with a total of 141 participants were included in the review, two of these were in children (aged six months to 14.5 years), and two did not specify participants’ age. All studies used different formulations and doses of vitamin E for various durations of treatment (10 days to six months). Two studies compared the supplementation of fat-soluble as well as water-soluble formulations to no supplementation in different arms of the same study. A third study compared a water-soluble formulation to a placebo; and in the fourth study a fat-soluble formulation of vitamin E was assessed against placebo. There was limited detail about randomisation and blinding in the included studies which compromises the quality of the evidence base for the review. The heterogeneous mix of the formulations with differing biovailabilities among these studies also limits the generalisability of the data to the wider cystic fibrosis population. None of the studies in either comparison report the review's primary outcomes of vitamin E total lipid ratio or the incidence of vitamin E-specific deficiency disorders, or the secondary outcomes lung function or quality of life. Water-soluble vitamin E
Water-soluble vitamin E may improve serum vitamin E levels compared with control at six months, one study (45 participants), mean difference (MD) 19.74 umol/L (95% confidence interval (CI) 13.48 to 26.00) (low-quality evidence). Similar results were also seen at one month, two studies (32 participants), MD 17.66 umol/L (95% CI 10.59 to 24.74) and at three months, one study (45 participants), MD 11.61 umol/L (95% CI 4.77 to 18.45). Only one study (45 participants) reported weight (secondary outcome of growth and nutritional status) at one and six months, but showed no difference between treatment and control at either time point. Fat-soluble vitamin E
Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levels of serum vitamin E at one month with fat-soluble vitamin E compared with control, MD 13.59 umol/L (95% CI 9.52 to 17.66); however, at three months one study (36 participants) showed no difference between treatment and control. No studies in this comparison reported on growth or nutritional status. Vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels in people with cystic fibrosis, although evidence we assessed was low quality. No data on other outcomes of interest were available to allow conclusions about any other benefits of this therapy. In future, larger studies are needed, especially in people already being treated with enteric-coated pancreatic enzymes and supplemented with vitamin E, to look at more specific outcome measures such as vitamin E status, lung function and nutritional status. Future studies could also look at the optimal dose of vitamin E required to achieve maximal clinical effectiveness.","We identified four studies including 141 participants; two of these were in children (aged six months to 14.5 years) and two did not specify the age of the participants. Those taking part in the studies received different forms of vitamin E supplements (either water-soluble or fat-soluble), placebo (a substance containing no medication) or no supplements. Water-soluble vitamin E
Evidence from one study (45 participants) showed that supplementation may increase vitamin E levels in the blood after six months. Similar results were seen at the earlier time points of one month (two studies, 32 participants) and three three months (one study, 45 participants). Only one study (45 participants) reported weight at one and six months, but showed no difference between supplementation and placebo at either time point. Fat-soluble vitamin E
Two studies (36 participants) reported higher levels of serum vitamin E after one month of fat-soluble vitamin E supplements compared with no treatment, but a different study (36 participants) did not find any difference between supplementation and no treatment after three months. None of the studies in either comparison reported results for our planned outcomes of vitamin E total lipid ratio, the incidence of vitamin E-specific deficiency disorders, lung function or quality of life. The results showed that vitamin E supplementation may lead to an improvement in vitamin E levels in people with cystic fibrosis, but the quality of the evidence was low. Future studies should look at more specific outcomes such as vitamin E status, lung function and nutritional status, especially in people already receiving treatment with pancreatic enzymes and vitamin E supplements. They could also look at the best level of vitamin E supplements needed to be most clinically effective."
CD007501,"We identified three eligible studies after screening a total of 255 unique records. All three were performed in the United States of America and recruited substance-abusing male and female adolescents (total N=615) through homeless shelters into randomised controlled trials of independent and non-overlapping behavioural interventions. The three trials differed in theoretical background, delivery method, dosage (number of sessions,) content and outcome assessments. Overall, the variability in delivery and outcomes precluded estimation of summary of effect measures. We assessed the risk of bias to be high for each of the studies. Whilst some effect of the interventions on outcome measures were reported, heterogeneity and lack of robustness in these studies necessitate caution in interpreting the effectiveness of these interventions. The body of evidence does not permit conclusions on the impact of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour in homeless youth; more research is required. While the psychosocial and contextual factors that fuel sexual risk behaviours among homeless youth challenge stringent methodologies of RCT's, novel ways for program delivery and trial retention are in need of development. Future trials should comply with rigorous methodology in design, delivery, outcome measurement and reporting.","We found three eligible independently conducted randomised controlled trials testing three different interventions. All three were conducted in the United States, amongst a total of 615 homeless, male and female youth. Due to the varied delivery of interventions, outcome measurement and reporting, we were unable to aggregate outcomes to estimate summary of effect measures. The significant risk of bias associated with the three included studies and their heterogeneity necessitate caution in interpreting the effectiveness of interventions to modify sexual risk behaviour for preventing HIV in homeless youth. While studies among homeless youth are highly challenging, future trials should comply with rigorous methodology in design, delivery, outcome measurement and reporting as well as consider the changing facets of homeless youth when designing HIV prevention tools."
CD005525,"We included three trials with a total of 128 participants in this review. The duration of zinc supplementation ranged between four and 12 weeks. Risk of bias was unclear for most studies regarding selection bias (random sequence generation, allocation concealment) and detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment). No study reported on our key outcome measures (incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, adverse events, health-related quality of life, all-cause mortality, diabetic complications, socioeconomic effects). Evaluation of insulin resistance as measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) showed neutral effects when comparing zinc supplementation with control (two trials; 114 participants). There were neutral effects for trials comparing zinc supplementation with placebo for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (2 studies, 70 participants). The one trial comparing zinc supplementation with exercise also showed neutral effects for total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, and a mean difference in triglycerides of -30 mg/dL (95% confidence interval (CI) -49 to -10) in favour of zinc supplementation (53 participants). Various surrogate laboratory parameters were also analysed in the included trials. There is currently no evidence on which to base the use of zinc supplementation for the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Future trials should investigate patient-important outcome measures such as incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, health-related quality of life, diabetic complications, all-cause mortality and socioeconomic effects.","We included three randomised controlled studies with a total of 128 participants in this review.

The effects of zinc supplementation are uncertain regarding insulin resistance and lipid levels in the blood (mainly cholesterol and triglycerides). In addition, the number of studies and participants is low and the study authors did not investigate important outcomes such as new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus or side effects of zinc supplementation."
CD009004,"We identified five randomised clinical trials with 290 patients. All trials were considered to have high risk of bias. Patients in the experimental group received compound phyllanthus for three months to 12 months. Patients in the antiviral drug group received lamivudine, interferon alpha, thymosin, or thymosin alpha 1. None of the trials reported mortality, hepatitis B-related morbidity, quality of life, or liver histology. Phyllanthus seemed to have a superior effect on clearance of serum HBeAg at the end of treatment in conventional meta-analysis (RR 0.76; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91, P = 0.002; I2 = 0%), but not when trial sequential analysis was applied. Phyllanthus had no significant effect on clearance of serum HBsAg (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.93 to 1.08, P = 0.92; I2 = 0%) or HBV DNA (RR 0.83; 95% CI 0.53 to 1.31, P = 0.43; I2 = 70%) when compared with antiviral drugs. Data on HBeAg seroconversion was reported in one trial and no significant difference was found comparing phyllanthus versus lamivudine (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.11). No data were reported on adverse events in the five trials. There is currently insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of phyllanthus for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Researchers who are interested in conducting further randomised clinical trials on phyllanthus ought to monitor both beneficial and harmful effects and should primarily test the herb against placebo in addition to antiviral drugs that are known to offer more benefit than harm. Only in this way new interventions can be assessed without compromising personal ethical considerations.","The findings of this review are based on five randomised clinical trials with 290 patients. Phyllanthus was tested versus antiviral drugs, including lamivudine, interferon alpha, thymosin, or thymosin alpha 1 for three months to 12 months. The primary findings of this review are that phyllanthus seemed to have a superior effect on clearance of serum HBeAg at the end of treatment in conventional meta-analysis, but not when trial sequential analysis was applied. Phyllanthus had no significant effect on clearance of serum HBsAg, serum HBV DNA, or HBeAg seroconversion when compared with antiviral drugs. No data were identified on mortality or morbidity, adverse events, quality of life, or liver histology. We need more randomised trials to confirm or reject the potential effects of phyllanthus. We advocate that phyllanthus is primarily assessed against placebo. This can be done in randomised clinical trials in which all patients receive antiviral drugs that are known to offer more benefit than harm and the patients are then randomised to phyllanthus versus placebo."
CD001199,"A total of 12 randomised trials were identified, totaling 843 patients. The size of the randomised clinical trials ranged from 30 to 155 patients. Both preoperative (neoadjuvant) and postoperative (adjuvant), systemic and locoregional (+/- embolisation), chemo- and immunotherapy interventions were tested. Treatment regimens and patients selected were not comparable, so no pooling was done. Only one regimen using preoperative transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation with doxorubicin was similar in two trials. Four of the twelve trials reported survival benefit at five years when given adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. Disease-free survival was reported in nine trials, and the estimated hazard ratios show that disease-free survival was significant in two trials at five years. These two trials had not shown a survival advantage, but the recurrence was significantly lower in patients given adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy. The highest toxicity rate was in a trial using oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5-fluorouracil which resulted in 12 out of 38 patients being withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events. There is no clear evidence for efficacy of any of the adjuvant and neo-adjuvant protocols reviewed, but there is some evidence to suggest that adjuvant therapy may be beneficial offering prolonged disease-free survival. In order to detect a realistic treatment advantage, larger trials with lower risk of systematic error will have to be conducted.","A total of 12 randomised trials were identified, totaling 843 patients. The size of the randomised clinical trials ranged from 30 to 155 patients. Nine of the twelve trials reported no survival benefit from adjuvant therapy. Two trials reported a significant difference for survival and four studies for disease-free survival for the treatment group, but the results of one of the trials on both its groups were very poor when compared to other trials. Two of the trials that did not report any absolute survival advantage reported statistically significant differences in disease-free survival. The highest toxicity rate was in a trial using oral 1-hexylcarbamoyl 5- fluorouracil which resulted in 12 out of 38 patients being withdrawn from the trial because of adverse events. In conclusion, this review found insufficient evidence to show that adjuvant and neo-adjuvant therapy increase survival from hepatocellular carcinoma, but there is limited evidence to suggest that neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy may be useful for disease-free survival."
CD004856,"Eight studies with 343 participants were included. The review found evidence for lower post-treatment OCD severity and reduced risk of continuing with OCD for the BT/CBT group compared to pill placebo or wait-list comparisons. There was no evidence found that the efficacy of BT/CBT alone and medication alone differ in terms of post treatment symptom severity or in the risk of having OCD. There was some evidence of a benefit for combined BT/CBT and medication compared to medication alone but not relative to BT/CBT alone. The low rates of drop out suggested BT/CBT is an acceptable treatment to child and adolescent patients and their families. Although only based on a small number of studies which vary in quality, behavioural or cognitive-behaviour therapy alone appears to be an effective treatment for OCD in children and adolescents. It is as effective as medication alone and may lead to better outcomes when combined with medication compared to medication alone. Additional higher quality trials are needed to confirm these findings.","This review identified eight randomised controlled trials involving 343 participants, evaluating the benefits of behavioural and cognitive-behavioural therapy. The results show that, compared to a wait-list or pill placebo, BT/CBT is an effective treatment for reducing OCD symptoms and lowering the risk of having OCD after treatment. Based on three studies that directly compared BT/CBT with medication, there was no current evidence to suggest that either BT/CBT or medication was superior to the other. Although based on a small number of studies, these findings provide support for the value of BT/CBT in the treatment of children and adolescents with OCD. When combined with medication, BT/CBT produces better outcomes than medication alone."
CD009177,"We identified 16 trials involving a total of 616 participants. Eight different types of interventions were studied. Eight trials investigated the effects of electrical brain stimulation (transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES); five trials) or repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS; three trials). Interventions in the remaining studies included exercise programmes (three trials); acupuncture (two trials); self-hypnosis (one trial); transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) (one trial); and a cognitive behavioural programme (one trial). None of the included trials were considered to have low overall risk of bias. Twelve studies had high overall risk of bias, and in four studies risk of bias was unclear. The overall quality of the included studies was weak. Their validity was impaired by methodological weaknesses such as inappropriate choice of control groups. An additional search in November 2014 identified more recent studies that will be included in an update of this review. For tDCS the pooled mean difference between intervention and control groups in pain scores on an 11-point visual analogue scale (VAS) (0-10) was a reduction of -1.90 units (95% confidence interval (CI) -3.48 to -0.33; P value 0.02) in the short term and of -1.87 (95% CI -3.30 to -0.45; P value 0.01) in the mid term. Exercise programmes led to mean reductions in chronic shoulder pain of -1.9 score points for the Short Form (SF)-36 item for pain experience (95% CI -3.4 to -0.4; P value 0.01) and -2.8 pain VAS units (95% CI -3.77 to -1.83; P value < 0.00001); this represented the largest observed treatment effects in the included studies. Trials using rTMS, CES, acupuncture, self-hypnosis, TENS or a cognitive behavioural programme provided no evidence that these interventions reduce chronic pain. Ten trials examined study endpoints other than pain, including anxiety, depression and quality of life, but available data were too scarce for firm conclusions to be drawn. In four trials no side effects were reported with study interventions. Five trials reported transient mild side effects. Overall, a paucity of evidence was found on any serious or long-lasting side effects of the interventions. Evidence is insufficient to suggest that non-pharmacological treatments are effective in reducing chronic pain in people living with SCI. The benefits and harms of commonly used non-pharmacological pain treatments should be investigated in randomised controlled trials with adequate sample size and study methodology.","We searched electronic databases until March 2011 and found 16 randomised controlled trials with a total of 616 participants. We grouped these studies by type of treatment into eight groups: Eight studies were on brain stimulation, of which five used electronic and three magnetic stimulation. Three studies were on exercise programmes, two on acupuncture and one each on self-hypnosis, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and a cognitive behavioural programme. The overall quality of the studies was low. An additional search in November 2014 identified more recent studies that will be included in an update of this review. The pooled results suggest that tDCS reduced pain in the short term and in the mid term. Also, exercise programmes for chronic shoulder pain provided pain relief. We found no evidence to suggest that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES), acupuncture, self-hypnosis or TENS is better than the respective control interventions for reducing chronic pain. Regarding outcomes other than pain, such as anxiety, depression or quality of life, as well as long-lasting side effects, no overall conclusions were possible, given that data were sparse. The included studies do not permit firm conclusions regarding whether treatments other than medication for chronic SCI pain are effective and safe."
CD004426,"The authors reviewed 1335 abstracts, and from these identified 21 potentially eligible abstracts. Upon detailed review, 12 studies fulfilled the entry criteria. Of these, eight were new studies that had been published since the previous version of this review. Two studies which were included in the previous version of this review were excluded because of potential for bias. The comparability of the included studies is extremely low because of differences in the specific diseases studied, differences in the therapeutic agents used, dosage, study design, and outcomes. The methodological quality of included studies was generally high, although risk of bias was unclear in random sequence generation and allocation concealment for most studies. Otherwise, the risk of bias was low for most studies in the other categories. Serious adverse events were uncommon, except for peripheral nerve toxicity in a long-term trial of dichloroacetate (DCA) in adults. One trial studied high-dose coenzyme Q10 without clinically meaningful improvement (although there were multiple biochemical, physiologic, and neuroimaging outcomes, in 30 participants). Three trials used creatine monohydrate alone, with one reporting evidence of improved measures of muscle strength and post-exercise lactate, but the other two reported no benefit (total of 38 participants). One trial studied the effects of a combination of coenzyme Q10, creatine monohydrate, and lipoic acid and reported a statistically significant improvement in biochemical markers and peak ankle dorsiflexion strength, but overall no clinical improvement in 16 participants. Five trials studied the effects of DCA: three trials in children showed a statistically significant improvement in secondary outcome measures of mitochondrial metabolism (venous lactate in three trials, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in one trial; total of 63 participants). One trial of short-term DCA in adults demonstrated no clinically relevant improvement (improved venous lactate but no change in physiologic, imaging, or questionnaire findings, in eight participants). One longer-term DCA trial in adults was terminated prematurely due to peripheral nerve toxicity without clinical benefit (assessments included the GATE score, venous lactate and MRS, in 30 participants). One trial using dimethylglycine showed no significant effect (measurements of venous lactate and oxygen consumption (VO2) in five participants). One trial using a whey-based supplement showed statistically significant improvement in markers of free radical reducing capacity but no clinical benefit (assessments included the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire and UK Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength, in 13 participants). Despite identifying eight new trials there is currently no clear evidence supporting the use of any intervention in mitochondrial disorders. Further research is needed to establish the role of a wide range of therapeutic approaches. We suggest further research should identify novel agents to be tested in homogeneous study populations with clinically relevant primary endpoints.","The included studies are not easily comparable because of differences in the treatment being studied, the dosage of these treatments, the length of study (and other differences in the study methods), and differences in the types of participants included for the research. The studies were generally well designed in order to reduce the possibility of bias, although for most studies the methods describing how participants were randomised were not described in detail. Otherwise, the risk of bias was low for most studies in the other categories. Serious side effects of treatment were uncommon, except for nerve damage in a long-term trial of dichloroacetate in adults. One trial studied high-dose coenzyme Q10 treatment. Three trials used creatine monohydrate: one trial reported improved muscle strength and biochemical measurements, but the other two trials reported no benefit (total of 38 participants). One trial studied the effects of a combination of coenzyme Q10, creatine monohydrate and lipoic acid, and reported a statistically significant improvement in biochemical measurements and ankle strength, but no clinical improvement (16 participants). Five trials studied the effects of dichloroacetate: three trials in children showed a statistically significant improvement in biochemical measurements but no clinical benefit on physiological measurements and exercise tests (total 63 participants); one trial of short-term therapy in adults demonstrated no clinical improvement in physiological measurements (total eight participants), and one longer-term trial in adults was terminated prematurely due to adverse effects without clinical benefit (using a combined scale of treatment effect, in 30 participants). One trial using dimethylglycine showed no significant effect on biochemical markers in five participants. One trial using a whey-based supplement demonstrated statistically significant improvement in biochemical markers but no clinical benefit in muscle strength or on health questionnaires (13 participants)."
CD011771,"One RCT was identified that compared different platelet transfusion thresholds prior to insertion of a CVC in people with chronic liver disease. This study is still recruiting participants (expected recruitment: up to 165 participants) and is due to be completed in December 2017. There were no completed studies. There were no studies that compared no platelet transfusions to a platelet transfusion threshold. There is no evidence from RCTs to determine whether platelet transfusions are required prior to central line insertion in patients with thrombocytopenia, and, if a platelet transfusion is required, what is the correct platelet transfusion threshold. Further randomised trials with robust methodology are required to develop the optimal transfusion strategy for such patients. The one ongoing RCT involving people with cirrhosis will not be able to answer this review's questions, because it is a small study that assesses one patient group and does not address all of the comparisons included in this review. To detect an increase in the proportion of participants who had major bleeding from 1 in 100 to 2 in 100 would require a study containing at least 4634 participants (80% power, 5% significance).",In this review one randomised controlled trial was identified that compared giving platelet transfusions at a low platelet count (25 x 109/l) versus giving platelet transfusions at a higher platelet count (50 x 109/l) prior to insertion of a central line to prevent bleeding. This trial is still recruiting and is due to complete recruitment in December 2017. There were no trials that compared no platelet transfusions versus giving platelet transfusions at a prespecified platelet count. We would need to design a study with at least 4634 participants to be able to detect an increase in the number of people who had major bleeding from 1 in 100 to 2 in 100.
CD004274,"We identified 24 RCTs involving 3739 participants which were included in the review. IHCAs had a significant positive effect on knowledge (SMD 0.46; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22 to 0.69), social support (SMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.52) and clinical outcomes (SMD 0.18; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.35). Results suggest it is more likely than not that IHCAs have a positive effect on self-efficacy (a person's belief in their capacity to carry out a specific action) (SMD 0.24; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.48). IHCAs had a significant positive effect on continuous behavioural outcomes (SMD 0.20; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.40). Binary behavioural outcomes also showed a positive effect for IHCAs, although this result was not statistically significant (OR 1.66; 95% CI 0.71 to 3.87). It was not possible to determine the effects of IHCAs on emotional or economic outcomes. IHCAs appear to have largely positive effects on users, in that users tend to become more knowledgeable, feel better socially supported, and may have improved behavioural and clinical outcomes compared to non-users. There is a need for more high quality studies with large sample sizes to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness.","The review authors found that IHCAs improved users' knowledge, social support, health behaviours and clinical outcomes.

There is a need for more large, high quality studies to confirm these preliminary findings, to determine the best type and best way to deliver IHCAs, and to establish how IHCAs have their effects for different groups of people with chronic illness."
CD012442,"We identified one randomised controlled trial that included 226 people with high-risk neuroblastoma who were pre-treated with autologous HSCT. The study randomised 113 participants to receive immunotherapy including isotretinoin, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and ch14.18, a type of anti-GD2 antibody also known as dinutuximab. The study randomised another 113 participants to receive standard therapy including isotretinoin. The results on overall survival favoured the dinutuximab-containing immunotherapy group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 0.80; P = 0.004). The results on event-free survival also favoured the dinutuximab-containing immunotherapy group (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.92; P = 0.020). Randomised data on adverse events were not reported separately. The study did not report progression-free survival, late non-haematological toxicity, and health-related quality of life as separate endpoints. We graded the quality of the evidence as moderate. The evidence base favours dinutuximab-containing immunotherapy compared to standard therapy concerning overall survival and event-free survival in people with high-risk neuroblastoma pre-treated with autologous HSCT. Randomised data on adverse events are lacking, therefore more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made regarding this outcome.","We included a single randomised trial (a type of study in which participants are assigned to one of two or more treatment groups using a random method) with 113 people allocated to immunotherapy including isotretinoin, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2, and ch14.18, a distinct type of anti-GD2 antibody also known as dinutuximab. Another 113 people were allocated to receive standard therapy including isotretinoin. The results on overall survival and event-free survival favoured the dinutuximab-containing immunotherapy group. We assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate. Other outcomes including those on adverse events were not adequately reported; more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made regarding these outcomes."
CD013089,"We included 35 randomised clinical trials with 3556 participants. One trial compared Radix Sophorae flavescentis with placebo; the remaining 34 trials compared effects of Radix Sophorae flavescentis in addition to a co-intervention versus the same co-intervention. The included trials assessed heterogenous forms and ways of administering Radix Sophorae flavescentis (e.g. oral capsules, oral tablets, intravenous infusion, intramuscular injection, acupoint (a specifically chosen site of acupuncture) injection) with treatment duration of 1 to 24 months. Two of the trials included children up to 14 years old. Participants in two trials had cirrhosis in addition to chronic hepatitis B. All trials were assessed at high risk of bias, and certainty of the evidence for all outcomes was very low. Only one of the 35 trials assessed mortality; no deaths occurred. Ten trials assessed serious adverse events; no serious adverse events occurred. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, hepatitis B-related mortality, or morbidity. Adverse events considered 'not to be serious' was an outcome in 19 trials; nine of these trials had zero events in both groups. Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus placebo or no intervention showed no difference in effects on adverse events considered 'not to be serious' (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.59; I² = 49%; 10 trials, 1050 participants). Radix Sophorae flavescentis showed a reduction in the proportion of participants with detectable HBV-DNA (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.68; I² = 56%; 29 trials, 2914 participants) and in the proportion of participants with detectable HBeAg (hepatitis B e-antigen) (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.76; I² = 19%; 20 trials, 2129 participants). Seven of the 35 randomised clinical trials received academic funding from government or hospital. Four trials received no funding. The remaining 24 trials provided no information on funding. Additionally, 432 trials lacked the methodological information needed to ensure inclusion of these trials in our review. The included trials lacked data on health-related quality of life, hepatitis B-related mortality, and hepatitis B-related morbidity. The effects of Radix Sophorae flavescentis on all-cause mortality and on the proportion of participants with serious adverse events and adverse events considered 'not to be serious' remain unclear. We advise caution in interpreting results showing that Radix Sophorae flavescentis reduced the proportion of people with detectable HBV-DNA and detectable HBeAg because the trials reporting on these outcomes are at high risk of bias and both outcomes are non-validated surrogate outcomes. We were unable to obtain information on the design and conduct of a large number of trials; therefore, we were deterred from including them in our review. Undisclosed funding may influence trial results and may lead to poor trial design. Given the wide usage of Radix Sophorae flavescentis, we need large, unbiased, high-quality placebo-controlled randomised trials in which patient-centred outcomes are assessed.","We included 35 randomised clinical trials with 3556 participants. One trial compared Radix Sophorae flavescentis with placebo; the remaining 34 trials compared effects of Radix Sophorae flavescentis in addition to a co-intervention versus the same co-intervention.

Two trials assessed children under 14 years of age. Participants in two trials had cirrhosis in chronic hepatitis B (late-stage scarring of the liver). Only one of the 35 trials assessed mortality; no deaths occurred. Ten trials assessed serious adverse events; no serious adverse events occurred. None of the trials assessed health-related quality of life, and no trials followed people who died from hepatitis B or were at risk of dying because of hepatitis B. Adverse events considered 'not to be serious' was an outcome in 19 trials. We cannot say if Radix Sophorae flavescentis versus placebo or no intervention is better or worse regarding the occurrence of adverse events considered 'not to be serious'. Radix Sophorae flavescentis reduced the proportion of people with detectable HBV-DNA and also the proportion of people with detectable HBeAg. Seven of the 35 randomised clinical trials received academic funding from government or hospital. Four trials received no funding. The remaining 24 trials provided no information on funding. The 432 trials identified could not be included in the review because of lack of information required for the conduct of this review. The certainty of evidence on the use of Radix Sophorae flavescentis for people with chronic HBV in terms of its beneficial or harmful effects on death, health-related quality of life, risk of dying due to HBV infection, and serious adverse events cannot be determined, as only a few trials aimed to explore patient-relevant outcomes. Our certainty in the evidence that Radix Sophorae flavescentis, when compared with no intervention or placebo, decreases or increases adverse events considered not to be serious in people with chronic hepatitis B is very low. Our certainty in the evidence that Radix Sophoae flavescentis decreases the proportion of people with detectable HBV-DNA and the proportion of people with detectable HBeAg is also very low."
CD002247,"Six trials involving 705 patients were included. Mortality was not significantly different between groups, which was low in both the primary repair (1.94%) and the diverted groups (1.74%). The Peto OR for mortality was 1.22 (95% CI 0.40 to 3.74). However, the primary repair group experienced a significantly lower rate of complications (Peto OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.39 to 0.76), total infectious complications (Peto OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.1), abdominal infections including dehiscence (Peto OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.3), abdominal infections excluding dehiscence (Peto OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.34 to 1.39), wound complications including dehiscence (Peto OR 0.73; 95% CI 0.38 to 1.39), and wound complications excluding dehiscence (Peto OR 0.67; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.39). Statistical significance favoring primary repair over fecal diversion was achieved for all outcomes related to abdominal infections and wound complications when one study was excluded for both clinical and statistical heterogeneity in the sensitivity analysis. Meta-analysis of currently published randomized controlled trials favors primary repair over fecal diversion for penetrating colon injuries.","Results were reported for a total of 705 patients. The two groups sustained significant injuries with the primary repair patients at least as ill as the diverted patients. The number of deaths was similar in both the primary repair (1.94%) and the diverted groups (1.74%). Total complications, total infectious complications, abdominal infections and wound complications all favored primary repair. The review authors searched the medical literature and found six controlled studies in which patients were randomized to primary repair or fecal diversion."
CD004036,"Two randomised clinical trials were eligible for inclusion. One trial compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone versus saline in 17 patients. Hydrocortisone tended to increase adverse events (pancreatitis, cholangitis with septicaemia, paranoid ideas, fluid retention) (RR 3.43, 95% CI 0.51 to 22.9) and had no cholangiographic improvement, which led to termination of the trial. The other trial compared budesonide versus prednisone in 18 patients. Patients had statistically significant higher serum bilirubin concentration after treatment with prednisone compared with budesonide (MD 10.4 µmol/litre, 95% CI 1.16 to 19.64 µmol/litre). No other statistically significant effects on clinical or biochemical outcomes were reported on any of the evaluated interventions. There is no evidence to support or refute peroral glucocorticosteroids for patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis. The intrabiliary application of corticosteroids via nasobiliary tube seems to induce severe adverse effects.","One trial compared biliary lavage with hydrocortisone versus saline. The other trial compared oral administration of budesonide versus prednisone. No statistically significant effects were found on mortality, serum activity of alkaline phosphatases, serum bilirubin, and adverse events for any of the evaluated intervention regimens. Two trials on glucocorticosteroids for primary sclerosing cholangitis were identified."
CD006212,"We identified four new studies for this update, bringing the total to six included studies involving 1388 participants. The six studies were clinically heterogeneous and we were unable to carry out meta-analysis. Only two studies were considered to be both applicable in current clinical settings and of good methodological quality. One was a randomised open-label trial studying the effect of a retrievable inferior vena caval filter plus anticoagulation versus anticoagulation alone on risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) in 399 participants over three months. There was no evidence of a difference in the rates of PE, death, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or bleeding at three and six months after the intervention (moderate-certainty evidence). A filter was inserted in 193 people, but could only be successfully retrieved from 153. Minor filter complications were noted at six months. The second clinically relevant study was a randomised open-label trial of 240 participants who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries, allocated to a filter or no filter, three days after injury, in conjunction with anticoagulation and intermittent pneumatic compression. Prophylactic anticoagulation was initiated in both groups when it was thought safe to do so. There was no evidence of a difference in symptomatic PE, death, or lower limb venous thrombosis rates (moderate-certainty evidence). The only major filter complication was that one person required surgical removal of the filter. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. One study showed an increased incidence of long-term lower extremity DVT at eight years. Three studies are no longer clinically applicable because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine prophylactic anticoagulation which is current standard practice. The fourth study compared two filter types and was terminated prematurely as one filter group had a higher rate of thrombosis compared to the other filter type. Two of the six identified studies were relevant for current clinical settings. One showed no evidence of a benefit of retrievable filters in acute PE for the outcomes of PE, death, DVT and bleeding during the initial three months in people who can receive anticoagulation (moderate-certainty evidence). The other study did not show any benefit for prophylactic filter insertion in people who sustained multiple traumatic injuries, with respect to symptomatic PE, mortality, or lower extremity venous thrombosis (moderate-certainty evidence). We can draw no firm conclusions regarding filter efficacy in the prevention of PE from the remaining four RCTs identified in this review. Further trials are needed to assess vena caval filter effectiveness and safety, and clinical differences between various filter types.","We included six trials with a total of 1388 participants in the review (current until 10 September 2019). Only minor complications from the filters were noted at six months. Another study of people who had sustained multiple traumatic injuries did not show any benefit of inserting a filter three days after injury to prevent PE, or reduce deaths. We are unable to draw any conclusions from the remaining four included studies. One study showed an increased rate of lower-extremity DVT in the permanent filter group. This is because three studies are no longer clinically relevant because they utilised permanent filters which are seldom used now, or they did not use routine preventative anticoagulation which is current standard practice. The fourth study compared two filter types and was stopped prematurely and thus did not generate sufficient data. Two studies were relevant in current clinical contexts. One trial showed there is no clear benefit in receiving a retrievable filter for the first three months after an acute PE, for those who can receive anticoagulation, in terms of recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), death or bleeding. The evidence presented by both of these studies is of moderate certainty. There is a further need for trials evaluating the effectiveness of caval filters in people who cannot receive anticoagulation, or when PE occurs despite adequate anticoagulation."
CD009697,"We included 10 trials, with a total of 422 participants, that addressed two of the outcomes of interest to this review: swelling (oedema) and bruising (ecchymosis). Nine studies on rhinoplasty used a variety of different types, and doses, of corticosteroids. Overall, the results of the included studies showed that there is some evidence that perioperative administration of corticosteroids decreases formation of oedema over the first two postoperative days. Meta-analysis was only possible for two studies, with a total of 60 participants, and showed that a single perioperative dose of 10 mg dexamethasone decreased oedema formation in the first two days after surgery (SMD = -1.16, 95% CI: -1.71 to -0.61, low quality evidence). The evidence for ecchymosis was less consistent across the studies, with some contradictory results, but overall there was some evidence that perioperatively administered corticosteroids decreased ecchymosis formation over the first two days after surgery (SMD = -1.06, 95% CI:-1.47 to -0.65, two studies, 60 participants, low quality evidence ). The difference was not maintained after this initial period. One study, with 40 participants, showed that high doses of methylprednisolone (over 250 mg) decreased both ecchymosis and oedema between the first and seventh postoperative days. The only study that assessed facelift surgery identified no positive effect on oedema with preoperative administration of corticosteroids. Five trials did not report on harmful (adverse) effects; four trials reported that there were no adverse effects; and one trial reported adverse effects in two participants treated with corticosteroids as well as in four participants treated with placebo. None of the studies reported recovery time, patient satisfaction or quality of life. The studies included were all at an unclear risk of selection bias and at low risk of bias for other domains. There is limited evidence for rhinoplasty that a single perioperative dose of corticosteroids decreases oedema and ecchymosis formation over the first two postoperative days, but the difference is not maintained after this period. There is also limited evidence that high doses of corticosteroids decrease both ecchymosis and oedema between the first and seventh postoperative days. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown and there is little evidence available regarding the safety of this intervention. More studies are needed because at present the available evidence does not support the use of corticosteroids for prevention of complications following facial plastic surgery.","The review authors searched the medical literature up to January 2014, and identified 10 relevant medical trials, with a total of 422 participants. Nine of these studies were on people having rhinoplasty (surgery to reshape the nose) and one was on people having a facelift.The trials investigated a variety of corticosteroid medicines, as well as different doses of corticosteroids. Five trials did not report on harmful (adverse) effects; four trials reported that there were no adverse effects; and one trial reported adverse effects in two participants treated with corticosteroids as well as in four participants treated with placebo. None of the studies reported recovery time, patient satisfaction or quality of life. There was some low quality evidence that a single dose of corticosteroid administered prior to surgery might reduce swelling and bruising over the first two days after surgery, but this advantage was not maintained beyond two days. One study, with 40 participants, showed that high doses of corticosteroid decreased both swelling and bruising between the first and seventh postoperative days. The usefulness of these results is uncertain and there is currently no evidence regarding the safety of the treatment. Therefore, the current evidence does not support use of corticosteroids as a routine treatment in facial plastic surgery."
CD006398,"Five randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with 11,565 participants and three interrupted time series studies (ITSs) with 26.3 data points on average met the criteria. For educational interventions aiming at reducing injury rates among adults the pooled rate ratio after recalculation from effect sizes in three RCTs was 1.02 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.20). For educational interventions aiming at children the pooled rate ratio for injury rates in two RCTs was 1.27 (95% CI 0.51 to 3.16). One ITS study that evaluated the effect of an intervention that included financial incentives decreased the injury level immediately after the intervention with an effect size of -2.68 (95% CI -3.80 to -1.56) but did not have a significant effect on the injury trend over time with an effect size of -0.22 (95% CI -0.47 to 0.03). One ITS study that evaluated the effect of legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticide on fatal pesticide poisonings increased the level of poisonings immediately after the introduction with an effect size of 2.20 (95% CI 0.97 to 3.43) but led to decrease in the trend of poisonings over time with an effect size of -2.15 (95% CI -2.64 to -1.66). One ITS study documented four different regulations aiming to increase the use of rollover protective structures (ROPS) on tractors and their effect on injuries and fatal injuries. The introduction of two different pieces of legislation requiring ROPS on new tractors sold after a certain date was associated with a decrease of fatal injuries over the long term (effect size -0.93 95% CI -1.82 to -0.03). Otherwise the introduction of legislation was associated with an increase of injury rates. Introduction of legislation requiring ROPS on all tractors, old tractors included, was not associated with a decrease but with an increase of injuries and fatal injuries over the long term. The selected studies provided no evidence that educational interventions are effective in decreasing injury rates among agricultural workers. Financial incentives could reduce injury rates. Legislation to ban pesticides could be effective. Legislation expanding the use of safety devices (ROPS) on new tractors was associated with a decrease in fatal injuries.","Five randomised controlled trials with 11,565 participants and one interrupted time series study with 14 measurement points used combinations of various educational interventions and financial incentives. The effect of legislation was evaluated in two interrupted time series studies with on average 32.5 measurement points. One study evaluated regulations to prevent tractor rollover injuries in Sweden and another study evaluated regulation to reduce fatal pesticide poisonings in Sri Lanka. The studies provided no evidence that the educational interventions had an injury reducing effect. However, insurance premium discounts as a financial incentive decreased injuries claims in one study. Legislation to ban Endosulfan pesticides was associated with a reduction in fatal poisonings in the long term in another study. Specific legislative mandates expanding the use of Rollover Protective Structures (ROPS) on tractors were not associated with a reduction of injuries in one study."
CD008509,"We included 67 studies with 10,509 participants overall. Of these, 15 studies with 5787 participants used a placebo. Stone clearance: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha-blocker may result in a large increase in stone clearance (risk ratio (RR) 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.36 to 1.55; low-quality evidence). A subset of higher-quality, placebo-controlled trials suggest that the likely effect is probably smaller (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.25; moderate-quality evidence), corresponding to 116 more (95% CI 51 more to 182 more) stone clearances per 1000 participants. Major adverse events: Based on the overall analysis, treatment with an alpha-blocker may have little effect on major adverse events (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.96; low-quality evidence). A subset of higher-quality, placebo-controlled trials suggest that alpha-blockers likely increase the risk of major adverse events slightly (RR 2.09, 95% CI 1.13 to 3.86), corresponding to 29 more (95% CI 3 more to 75 more) major adverse events per 1000 participants. Patients treated with alpha-blockers may experience shorter stone expulsion times (mean difference (MD) -3.40 days, 95% CI -4.17 to -2.63; low-quality evidence), may use less diclofenac (MD -82.41, 95% CI -122.51 to -42.31; low-quality evidence), and likely require fewer hospitalisations (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.77; moderate-quality evidence), corresponding to 69 fewer hospitalisations (95% CI 93 fewer to 32 fewer) per 1000 participants. Meanwhile, the need for surgical intervention appears similar (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.02; low-quality evidence), corresponding to 28 fewer surgical interventions (95% CI 51 fewer to 2 more) per 1000 participants. A predefined subgroup analysis (test for subgroup differences; P = 0.002) suggests that effects of alpha-blockers may vary with stone size, with RR of 1.06 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.15; P = 0.16; I² = 62%) for stones 5 mm or smaller versus 1.45 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.72; P < 0.0001; I² = 59%) for stones larger than 5 mm. We found no evidence suggesting possible subgroup effects based on stone location or alpha-blocker type. For patients with ureteral stones, alpha-blockers likely increase stone clearance but probably also slightly increase the risk of major adverse events. Subgroup analyses suggest that alpha-blockers may be less effective for smaller (5 mm or smaller) than for larger stones (greater than 5 mm).","Based on our latest search of the literature from November 2017, we included 64 studies with 10,509 participants. Of these, 15 studies compared alpha-blockers with placebo with 5787 participants. Based on the subset of higher-quality studies that used a placebo, alpha-blockers likely resulted in more people passing their stones. People taking alpha-blockers may pass their stones in a shorter time, may use less diclofenac (which is a type of pain medication), and are likely to be admitted to the hospital less often. We could find no difference in how well alpha-blockers work, no matter where in the ureter the stone is stuck or what type of alpha-blocker is used. For patients with stones stuck in the ureter, alpha-blockers likely make passing the stone easier but cause slightly more unwanted effects. Upon completing additional analyses, we found that effects of alpha-blockers may be different in people with small (5 mm or smaller) versus larger (larger than 5 mm) stones."
CD010358,"Our systematic review included seven studies with a total of 492 participants. We included 422 participants in our analysis. Thirteen studies are awaiting classification. For the comparison dexmedetomidine versus placebo (six studies, 402 participants), most studies found a reduction in 'rescue' opioid consumption in the first 24 hours after surgery, together with in general no clinically important differences in postoperative pain (visual analogue scale (VAS) 0 to 100 mm, where 0 = no pain and 100 = worst imaginable pain) in the first 24 hours after surgery - except for one study (80 participants) with a reduction in VAS pain at two hours after surgery in favour of dexmedetomidine, with a mean difference of -30.00 mm (95% confidence interval (CI) -38.25 to -21.75). As the result of substantial heterogeneity, pooling of data in statistical meta-analyses was not appropriate. The quality of evidence was very low for our primary outcomes because of imprecision of results and risk of bias. Regarding our secondary aims, evidence was too scant in general to allow robust conclusions, or the estimates too imprecise or of poor methodological quality. Regarding adverse effects, low quality data (one study, 80 participants) suggest that the proportion of participants with hypotension requiring intervention was slightly higher in the high-dose dexmedetomidine group with a risk ratio of 2.50 (95% CI 0.94 to 6.66), but lower doses of dexmedetomidine led to no differences compared with control. Evidence for the comparison dexmedetomidine versus fentanyl was insufficient to permit robust conclusions (one study, 20 participants). Dexmedetomidine, when administered perioperatively for acute pain after abdominal surgery in adults, seemed to have some opioid-sparing effect together with in general no important differences in postoperative pain when compared with placebo. However the quality of the evidence was very low as the result of imprecision, methodological limitations and substantial heterogeneity among the seven included studies. The clinical importance for patients is uncertain, in as much as the influence of dexmedetomidine on patient-important outcomes such as gastrointestinal function, mobilization and adverse effects could not be satisfactorily determined. All included studies were relatively small, and publication bias could not be ruled out. Applicability of evidence was limited to middle-aged participants who were relatively free of co-morbidity and were undergoing elective abdominal surgery. A potential bias was a considerable quantity of unobtainable data from studies with mixed surgery. To detect and investigate patient-important outcomes, larger studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed.","We included seven studies with 492 participants from five different countries and included 422 participants in our analysis. In total, 13 studies are awaiting classification. Most of the studies that compared dexmedetomidine with no treatment found that dexmedetomidine reduced the need for opioids for treating pain for 24 hours after surgery. During the same period, no important differences in pain were noted, except one study (80 participants) showed a reduction in intensity of pain at two hours after surgery with dexmedetomidine. One study with 80 participants reported a higher rate of low blood pressure ('low' meaning that medication was required) for participants receiving a high dose of dexmedetomidine compared with no treatment, but for lower doses of dexmedetomidine, they noted no differences compared with no treatment. For the comparison dexmedetomidine versus fentanyl, data were insufficient to allow conclusions (only one small study). Dexmedetomidine - compared with no treatment - seemed to reduce the need for opioids without worsening the experience of postoperative pain after abdominal surgery in adults. However, the quality of evidence was very low because studies were poorly conducted and because results were not similar across studies. The importance of these findings for patients was also uncertain because the influence of dexmedetomidine on bowel function, mobilization and adverse effects could not be properly determined.The seven included studies were small, so side effects associated with use of dexmedetomidine may be greater than this review reported. In addition, we could not obtain relevant data from several studies because investigators mixed abdominal surgery with other types of surgery."
CD007982,"We included six randomised controlled trials involving 8372 people. All trials were judged to be at high risk of bias for at least one domain. Four trials compared email communication to standard mail and two compared email communication to usual care. For the primary health service outcome of uptake of preventive screening, there was no difference between email and standard mail (OR 0.93; 95% CI 0.69 to 1.24). For both comparisons (email versus standard mail and email versus usual care) there was no difference between the groups for patient or caregiver understanding and support. Results were inconclusive for patient or caregiver behaviours and actions. For email versus usual care only, there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome of patient health status and well-being. No data were reported relating to healthcare professionals or harms. The evidence on the use of email for the provision of information on disease prevention and health promotion was weak, and therefore inadequate to inform clinical practice. The available trials mostly provide inconclusive, or no evidence for the outcomes of interest in this review. Future research needs to use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the most recent developments in information technology, with consideration of the complexity of email as an intervention.","We found only six trials with 8372 participants in total. All of the trials had elements of bias. Four studies compared email to standard mail as a method of communication, and found that using email instead of mail did not make any difference to patient or caregiver understanding, or the uptake of preventive screening. Two studies compared email with usual care, and found that using email instead of usual methods of information delivery did make any difference to patient or caregiver understanding and support, or patient health status and well-being. We were unable to properly assess email's impact on patient or caregiver behaviours/actions as the results were mixed. We found that there was not much evidence on the effects of using email to give people information on disease prevention and health promotion."
CD004507,"We included seven RCTS in the review; we included six of these, totalling 485 couples, in the meta-analysis. No trials reported the primary outcome of live birth. The evidence was of very low-quality. The main limitations were (unclear) risk of bias, signs of imprecision and inconsistency in results among studies and the small number of studies/participants included. Swim-up versus gradient technique
Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) for swim-up versus a gradient technique (odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.35; I² = 71%; 4 RCTs, 370 participants; very low-quality evidence). The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a gradient technique is assumed to be 24%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim-up technique is between 14% and 30%. We are uncertain whether there was a real difference between ongoing pregnancy rates per couple (OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.82; heterogeneity not applicable; 1 RCT, 223 participants; very low-quality evidence). Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates (MPR) per couple comparing a swim-up versus gradient technique (MPR per couple 0% versus 0%; 1 RCT, 25 participants; very low-quality of evidence). Considering the quality of evidence, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between miscarriage rates (MR) per couple comparing a swim-up versus gradient technique (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.59; I² = 44%; 3 RCTs, 330 participants; very low-quality evidence). No studies reported on ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. Swim-up versus wash technique
Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a swim-up technique versus wash and centrifugation (OR 0.41, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.13; I² = 55%; 2 RCTs, 78 participants; very low-quality evidence). The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 38%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim-up technique is between 9% and 41%. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates between swim-up technique versus wash technique (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.02 to 13.28; heterogeneity not applicable; 1 RCT, 26 participants; very low-quality evidence). Miscarriage rate was only reported by one study: no miscarriages were reported in either treatment arm. No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. Gradient versus wash technique
Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.58 to 5.46; I² = 52%; 2 RCTs, 94 participants; very low-quality evidence). The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 13%, the chance of pregnancy after using the gradient technique is between 8% and 46%. Considering the quality of evidence, we are uncertain whether there was a difference between multiple pregnancy rates per couple between the treatment groups (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.83; very low-quality evidence). Considering the quality of evidence, we are also uncertain whether there was a difference between miscarriage rates per couple between the treatment groups (OR 6.11, 95% CI 0.27 to 138.45; very low-quality evidence). No studies reported on ongoing pregnancy rate, ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. The very low quality of the available evidence means we cannot be certain about the relative effectiveness of the different semen preparation techniques: swim-up versus gradient versus wash and centrifugation technique. No studies reported on live birth rates. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates, ongoing pregnancy rates, multiple pregnancy rates or miscarriage rates per couple between the three sperm preparation techniques. Further randomised trials are warranted that report live birth data","We found six randomised controlled trials comparing a gradient, swim-up or wash technique, in a total of 485 couples undergoing IUI. The main limitations were (unclear) risk of bias, signs of imprecision (small number of studies/participants included) and inconsistency in results among studies. We are uncertain whether there is a difference in pregnancy outcomes between the three sperm preparation techniques for subfertile couples undergoing IUI. No studies reported on ectopic pregnancy rate, fetal abnormalities or infection rate. Considering the quality of evidence (very low), we are uncertain whether there is a difference in clinical pregnancy rates after a swim-up technique versus wash and centrifugation. The results suggest that if the chance of pregnancy after the use of a wash technique is assumed to be 38%, the chance of pregnancy after using the swim-up technique is between 9% and 41%.

CD001848,"Twenty five studies (1305 participants) were included in the review, of which 22 studies (1060 participants) contributed data to meta-analyses. Based on thirteen studies, psychological therapies, all using a CBT approach, were more effective than TAU/WL in achieving clinical response at post-treatment (RR 0.64, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.74), and also in reducing anxiety, worry and depression symptoms. No studies conducted longer-term assessments of CBT against TAU/WL. Six studies compared CBT against supportive therapy (non-directive therapy and attention-placebo conditions). No significant difference in clinical response was indicated between CBT and supportive therapy at post-treatment (RR 0.86, 95%CI 0.70 to 1.06), however, significant heterogeneity was indicated, which was partly explained by the number of therapy sessions. Psychological therapy based on CBT principles is effective in reducing anxiety symptoms for short-term treatment of GAD. The body of evidence comparing CBT with other psychological therapies is small and heterogeneous, which precludes drawing conclusions about which psychological therapy is more effective. Further studies examining non-CBT models are required to inform health care policy on the most appropriate forms of psychological therapy in treating GAD.","The review included 25 studies, with a total of 1305 participants. None of the studies comparing CBT with treatment as usual or waiting list looked at the long-term effectiveness of CBT. All the studies used a CBT approach, and compared CBT against treatment as usual or waiting list (13 studies), or against another psychological therapy (12 studies). It is not clear whether people attending for CBT sessions were more likely to have reduced anxiety than people attending for psychodynamic therapy or supportive therapy, because only one study compared CBT with psychodynamic therapy, and the six studies that compared CBT with supportive therapy showed differing results. This review aimed to find out whether psychological therapies are effective for GAD, and whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is more effective than other psychological therapy approaches, including psychodynamic and supportive therapies. The review showed that people attending for psychological therapy based on a CBT approach were more likely to have reduced anxiety at the end of treatment than people who received treatment as usual or were on a waiting list for therapy. CBT was also very effective in reducing secondary symptoms of worry and depression. More studies should be carried out to establish whether psychodynamic and supportive therapies are effective for GAD, and whether CBT is more helpful than other psychological therapy approaches in treating GAD."
CD008819,"We included 13 studies with 1021 participants with varicose veins without healed or active venous ulceration. One study included pregnant women while other studies included participants who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology clinics or outpatient departments. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure, ranging from 10 mmHg to 50 mmHg. Five studies assessed compression stockings versus no compression stockings or placebo stockings. Three of these studies used knee-length stockings, one used full-length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee-length stockings. The risk of bias of many included trials was unclear, mainly because of inadequate reporting. We were unable to pool studies as they did not report the same outcomes or used different ways to assess them. Many studies were small and there were differences in the populations studied. The certainty of the evidence was therefore low to very low. Compression stockings compared with no treatment or placebo stockings
All four studies that reported change in symptoms found a subjective improvement by the end of the study. However, change in symptoms was not always analysed by comparing the randomised arms of the studies and was therefore subject to bias. Two studies assessed physiological measures using either ankle circumference or duplex sonography to measure oedema. Ankle circumference showed no clear difference between baseline and follow-up while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Three studies reported complications or side effects with itching and irritation the main side effects reported. None of the trials reported severe side effects. Reports of compliance varied between studies. One study reported a high dropout rate with low levels of compliance due to discomfort, application and appearance; two studies reported generally good levels of compliance in the stocking group compared to placebo/no treatment. Two studies reported comfort, tolerance and acceptability with outcomes affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in one study of non-pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. One study reported quality of life showing no clear differences between the stocking and placebo stocking groups. Compression stockings compared with different compression stockings
All five studies that reported change in symptoms found a subjective improvement in symptoms by the end of the study. Change in symptoms was not always analysed comparing the randomised arms of the trials and was therefore subject to bias. Five studies reported a variety of physiological measures such as foot volumetry, volume reduction and change in diameter. Generally, there were no clear differences between study arms. Four studies reported complications or side effects, including sweating, itching, skin dryness, and constriction and tightness. None of the trials reported severe side effects. Two studies reported compliance showing no difference in compliance rates between stockings groups, although one study reported high initial levels of dropout due to discomfort, appearance, non-effectiveness and irritation. Four studies reported comfort, tolerance and acceptability. Two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between groups. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. None of the studies assessed quality of life. No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies. There is insufficient high-certainty evidence to determine whether or not compression stockings are effective as the sole and initial treatment of varicose veins in people without healed or active venous ulceration, or whether any type of stocking is superior to any other type. Future research should consist of large RCTs of participants with trunk varices either wearing or not wearing compression stockings to assess the efficacy of this intervention. If compression stockings are found to be beneficial, further studies assessing which length and pressure is the most efficacious could then take place.","We included 13 studies involving 1021 participants with varicose veins who had not experienced venous ulceration in this review (search run May 2020). One study included only pregnant women, while other studies included people who had sought medical intervention for their varicose veins by being on surgical waiting lists, or attending vascular surgery or dermatology (skin care) clinics or outpatient departments. The stockings used in the studies exerted different levels of pressure. Five studies assessed compression stocking versus no compression stocking (for example no treatment or placebo stocking with no graduated elastic). Three of these studies used knee-length stockings, one used full-length stockings and one used full tights. Eight studies compared different types or pressures of knee-length stockings. Participants considered their symptoms had improved when stockings were worn in the nine studies that assessed this outcome, but these assessments were not always made by comparing one treatment group of the trial with a control group in the same study and was therefore subject to bias. Two studies comparing stockings with placebo stockings measured physical signs; there was no clear difference between baseline and follow-up for ankle circumference, while oedema was reduced in the stocking group compared with the placebo stocking group. Generally there were no clear differences between studies comparing two types of stockings for volume reduction and change in diameter (ways to measure oedema). Complications or side effects ranged from sweating, itching, irritation, skin dryness and a feeling of tightness. There were no severe or long-lasting side effects. Two studies comparing stockings with different stockings, and four studies comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed compliance (whether the person used the stockings as directed). In the stocking versus different stocking studies, there was no clear difference between the stockings, with generally low levels of compliance reported. In the stocking versus placebo/no treatment group, three studies reported results. Of these, one study reported a high initial dropout rate with generally low levels of compliance. The other two studies reported generally good compliance in the stocking group. Four studies that compared stockings with different stockings and two studies that compared stockings with placebo/no treatment assessed comfort, tolerance and acceptability of stockings. Comparing stockings with placebo/no treatment, comfort, tolerance and acceptability was affected by the study population. Compression tights were increasingly rejected by pregnant women as their pregnancy progressed, while in a study of non-pregnant women, the stockings group showed no more hindrance of normal activities and daytime discomfort when compared with placebo stockings. In the stocking versus different stockings studies, two studies reported similar levels of tolerance and discomfort between the types of stocking. Discomfort was the main reason for indicating a preference for one type of stocking over another. One study assessed quality of life, showing no clear differences between the stocking and no stocking groups. No conclusions regarding the optimum length or pressure of compression stockings could be made as there were no conclusive results from the included studies. Evidence from available trials is not sufficient to determine if compression stockings as the only and initial treatment are effective in managing and treating varicose veins in the early stages."
CD002786,"For this update, one additional study was suitable for inclusion, making a total of 13 trials with 2080 participants. Overall the certainty of the evidence was low or moderate due to short follow-up periods, heterogeneity between trials, small sample sizes, and risk of bias due to incomplete reporting. Medical adjuvant treatments used in the included trials were aspirin, ticlopidine, dipyridamole, dipyridamole plus aspirin, warfarin, fish oil, clopidogrel, sulphinpyrazone and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patch. All included studies reported on graft patency by measuring graft thrombosis. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency in studies comparing aspirin versus placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 2.25; 3 studies, 175 participants; low-certainty evidence). The meta-analysis for graft patency comparing ticlopidine versus placebo favoured ticlopidine (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.82; 3 studies, 339 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency in studies comparing fish oil versus placebo (OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.03 to 1.95; 2 studies, 220 participants; low-certainty evidence); and studies comparing clopidogrel and placebo (OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.19; 2 studies, 959 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Similarly, there was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency comparing the effect of dipyridamole versus placebo (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.11 to 1.94; 1 study, 42 participants, moderate-certainty evidence) and dipyridamole plus aspirin versus placebo (OR 0.64, CI 0.16 to 2.56; 1 study, 41 participants; moderate-certainty evidence); comparing low-intensity warfarin with placebo (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.78 to 3.99; 1 study, 107 participants; low-certainty evidence); comparing sulphinpyrazone versus placebo (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.03 to 5.98; 1 study, 16 participants; low-certainty evidence) and comparing GTN patch and placebo (OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.54; 1 study, 167 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). The single trial evaluating warfarin was terminated early because of major bleeding events in the warfarin group. Only two studies published data on the secondary outcome of related interventions (surgical or radiological); there was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in related interventions between placebo and treatment groups. None of the included studies reported on the duration of hospital stay. Most studies reported complications ranging from mortality to nausea. However, data on complications were limited and reporting varied between studies. The meta-analyses of three studies for ticlopidine (an antiplatelet treatment), which all used the same dose of treatment but with a short follow-up of only one month, suggest ticlopidine may have a beneficial effect as an adjuvant treatment to increase the patency of AVFs and AVGs in the short term. There was insufficient evidence to determine if there was a difference in graft patency between placebo and other treatments such as aspirin, fish oil, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, dipyridamole plus aspirin, warfarin, sulphinpyrazone and GTN patch. The certainty of the evidence was low to moderate due to short follow-up periods, the small number of studies for each comparison, small sample sizes, heterogeneity between trials and risk of bias due to incomplete reporting. Therefore, it appears reasonable to suggest further prospective studies be undertaken to assess the use of these antiplatelet drugs in renal patients with an AVF or AVG.","The review authors identified 13 randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment groups; evidence current to August 2020) with 2080 participants. Overall the certainty of the evidence was low to moderate, meaning that results may change with more research. The trials compared antithrombotic medicines (which prevent abnormal clotting in the blood vessels; such as ticlopidine, aspirin, dipyridamole and clopidogrel) and other types of medicine used to prevent blockages in the artery and vein access points for dialysis compared to placebo (dummy treatment). Three trials (339 participants) comparing ticlopidine (an antiplatelet treatment) with placebo showed improved patency in one month. There was insufficient evidence of an effect on blood flow from three trials comparing aspirin with placebo (175 participants) or from two trials using fish oil for 12 months (220 participants). Two trials compared clopidogrel with placebo in 959 participants and found insufficient evidence of an effect between the treatments. The trial comparing warfarin with placebo was terminated early because of major bleeding in the warfarin group. Two studies reported on related surgical or radiological interventions and found insufficient evidence of an effect on related interventions between placebo and treatment. No studies reported the length of hospital stay. Most studies reported complications ranging from feeling sick to death. However, information was limited and varied between studies."
CD008635,"The search identified 77 trials. We included 34 trials in the review involving 69,338 babies, five studies are awaiting classification and there are two ongoing community trials. Included studies were conducted in both developed and developing countries. Among the 34 included trials, three were large, cluster-randomized trials conducted in community settings in developing countries and 31 studies were conducted in hospital settings mostly in developed countries. Data for community and hospital studies were analyzed separately. The three trials conducted in community settings contributed 78% of the total number of children included in this review. Of the trials conducted in hospital settings, the majority had small sample sizes. There were 22 different interventions studied across the included trials and the most commonly studied antiseptics were 70% alcohol, triple dye and chlorhexidine. Only one antiseptic, chlorhexidine was studied in community settings for umbilical cord care. Three community trials reported data on all-cause mortality that comprised 1325 deaths in 54,624 participants and combined results showed a reduction of 23% (average risk ratio (RR) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63 to 0.94, random-effects, T² = 0.02, I² = 50%) in the chlorhexidine group compared with control. The reduction in omphalitis ranged from 27% to 56% depending on the severity of infection. Cord separation time was increased by 1.7 days in the chlorhexidine group compared with dry cord care (mean difference (MD) 1.75 days, 95% CI 0.44 to 3.05, random-effects, T² = 0.88, I² = 100%). Washing of umbilical cord with soap and water was not advantageous compared with dry cord care in community settings. Among studies conducted in hospital settings, no study reported data for mortality or tetanus. No antiseptic was advantageous to reduce the incidence of omphalitis compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. Topical triple dye application reduced bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus aureus compared with dry cord care (average RR 0.15, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.22, four studies, n = 1319, random-effects, T² = 0.04, I² = 24%) or alcohol application (average RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.80, two studies, n = 487, random-effects, T² = 0.00, I² = 0%). There was no advantage of application of alcohol and triple dye for reduction of colonization with streptococcus. Topical alcohol application was advantageous in reduction of colonization with Enterococcus coli compared with dry cord care (average RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.92, two studies, n = 432, random-effects, T² = 0.00, I² = 0%) and in a separate analysis, triple dye increased the risk of colonization compared with alcohol (RR 3.44, 95% CI 2.10 to 5.64, one study, n = 373). Cord separation time was significantly increased with topical application of alcohol (MD 1.76 days, 95% CI 0.03 to 3.48, nine studies, n = 2921, random-effects, T² = 6.54, I² = 97%) and triple dye (MD 4.10 days, 95% CI 3.07 to 5.13, one study, n = 372) compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. The number of studies was insufficient to make any inference about the efficacy of other antiseptics. There is significant evidence to suggest that topical application of chlorhexidine to umbilical cord reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis in community and primary care settings in developing countries. It may increase cord separation time however, there is no evidence that it increases risk of subsequent morbidity or infection. There is insufficient evidence to support the application of an antiseptic to umbilical cord in hospital settings compared with dry cord care in developed countries.","Thirty-four randomised controlled studies were included involving 69,338 babies. Three studies were conducted in community settings in developing countries; the remainder were conducted in hospital settings, mostly in developed countries. Studies conducted in community settings were large and contributed about 78% of all the participants included in this review. Hospital-based studies were small and had limitations. There were 22 different interventions studied. The most commonly studied antiseptics in the included studies were 70% alcohol, triple dye and chlorhexidine. Studies conducted in community settings evaluated the effectiveness of topical application of chlorhexidine and combined results showed that chlorhexidine reduced risk of death by 23% and the risk of cord infection ranging from 27% to 56%, depending on the severity of infection. Topical application of chlorhexidine may increase cord separation time by about 1.7 days, however, this does not increase subsequent risk of cord infection or death. None of the studies conducted in hospital settings reported data for risk of death or tetanus. No antiseptic was found to be advantageous for the prevention of cord infection compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. Topical triple dye application reduced bacterial colonization with Staphylococcus aureus compared to both dry cord care and alcohol application. There was no advantage of application of alcohol and triple dye for reduction of colonization with streptococcus. Topical alcohol application was advantageous in the reduction of colonization with Enterococcus coli compared with dry cord care and triple dye application. Cord separation time was increased with topical application of alcohol and triple dye compared with dry cord care in hospital settings. There were insufficient studies to determine the efficacy of other antiseptics. Infection of the umbilical cord stump (omphalitis), caused by skin bacteria, is a significant cause of illness and death in newborn babies in developing countries."
CD011768,"We included 23 studies (from 35 reports) with a total of 11,170 caregiver-infant pairs who were randomly assigned to receive an educational intervention delivered to the caregiver or usual care. Nineteen of the included studies were community-based studies while four were facility-based studies. In addition, 13 of the included studies were cluster-randomised while the others were individually randomised. Generally, the interventions were focused on the introduction of complementary feeding at the appropriate time, the types and amount of complementary foods to be fed to infants, and hygiene. Using the GRADE criteria, we assessed the quality of the evidence as moderate, mostly due to inadequate allocation concealment and insufficient blinding. Educational interventions led to improvements in complementary feeding practices for age at introduction of complementary foods (average RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.83 to 0.94; 4 studies, 1738 children; moderate-quality evidence) and hygiene practices (average RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.55; 4 studies, 2029 participants; moderate-quality evidence). For duration of exclusive breastfeeding, pooled results were compatible with both a reduction and an increase in the outcome (average RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.77 to 3.22; 3 studies, 1544 children; very low-quality evidence). There was limited (low to very low-quality) evidence of an effect for all growth outcomes. Quality of evidence
There is moderate to very low-quality evidence that educational interventions can improve complementary feeding practices but insufficient evidence to conclude that it impacts growth outcomes. Overall, we found evidence that education improves complementary feeding practices.","The search identified 23 studies involving a total of 11,170 caregivers and their children. Generally, the education messages were focused on the introduction of semi-solid foods at the appropriate age, the types and amount of complementary foods to be fed to infants, and hygiene. Hygiene practices of caregivers who received education also showed some improvement compared to those that did not (moderate-quality evidence). It also led to improvement in the quality and quantity of complementary foods fed to infants. There was no convincing evidence of an effect of education on the growth of children (low to very low-quality evidence). Overall, we found evidence that education improves complementary feeding practices."
CD010375,"Two randomised controlled trials recruiting a total of 413 patients met the criteria for inclusion in our review; one study had a low risk of bias and the other study had a high risk of bias. Ear plugs versus control
One study recruited 201 children (aged six months to six years) who underwent myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion. The study compared an intervention group who were instructed to swim and bathe with ear plugs with a control group; the participants were followed up at one-month intervals for one year. This study, with low risk of bias, showed that the use of ear plugs results in a small but statistically significant reduction in the rate of otorrhoea from 1.2 episodes to 0.84 episodes in the year of follow-up (mean difference (MD) -0.36 episodes per year, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.45 to -0.27). There was no significant difference in ventilation tube extrusion or hearing outcomes between the two study arms. No child required surgical intervention to remove ventilation tubes and no adverse events were reported. Water avoidance versus control
Another study recruited 212 children (aged three months to 12 years) who underwent myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion. The study compared an intervention group who were instructed not to swim or submerge their heads while bathing with a control group; the participants were followed up at three-month intervals for one year. This study, with high risk of bias, did not show any evidence of a reduction or increase in the rate of otorrhoea (1.17 episodes per year in both groups; MD 0 episodes, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.14). No other outcomes were reported for this study and no adverse events were reported. Quality of evidence
The overall quality (GRADE) of the body of evidence for the effect of ear plugs on the rate of otorrhoea and the effect of water avoidance on the rate of otorrhoea are low and very low respectively. The baseline rate of ventilation tube otorrhoea and the morbidity associated with it is usually low and therefore careful prior consideration must be given to the efficacy, costs and burdens of any intervention aimed at reducing this rate. While there is some evidence to suggest that wearing ear plugs reduces the rate of otorrhoea in children with ventilation tubes, clinicians and parents should understand that the absolute reduction in the number of episodes of otorrhoea appears to be very small and is unlikely to be clinically significant. Based on the data available, an average child would have to wear ear plugs for 2.8 years to prevent one episode of otorrhoea. Some evidence suggests that advising children to avoid swimming or head immersion during bathing does not affect rates of otorrhoea, although good quality data are lacking in this area. Currently, consensus guidelines therefore recommend against the routine use of water precautions on the basis that the limited clinical benefit is outweighed by the associated cost, inconvenience and anxiety. Future high-quality studies could be undertaken but may not be thought necessary. It is uncertain whether further trials in this area would change the findings of this review or have an impact on practice. Any future high-quality research should focus on determining whether particular groups of children benefit more from water precautions than others, as well as on developing clinical guidelines and their implementation.","We included two studies, recruiting a total of 413 patients. One study looked at 201 children between six months and six years who had ventilation tubes inserted to treat glue ear or recurrent infections. There was no effect on how long the tubes stayed in place or on hearing (although these results were only measured in one study). Another study looked at 212 children between three months and 12 years who had ventilation tubes inserted (we do not know precisely what for). We have graded the quality of evidence relating to water avoidance as very low (""we are very uncertain about the estimate""). The difference that wearing ear plugs makes appears to be very small and a child would have to wear them on average for almost three years to prevent one infection resulting in ear discharge. It may be that telling children to avoid swimming and putting their head under water makes no difference to whether or not they get ear infections, but this is very uncertain. Current expert guidelines for clinicians therefore recommend against routinely using water precautions because the limited clinical benefit is outweighed by the associated cost, inconvenience and anxiety. Future high-quality studies could be undertaken but may not be thought necessary. It is uncertain whether further trials in this area would change the findings of this review or have an impact on practice. Any future high-quality research should focus on determining whether particular groups of children benefit more from water precautions than others, as well as on developing clinical guidelines and their implementation."
CD008582,"Four studies were eligible for inclusion (281 participants): Two studies compared relaxation with electroacupuncture or superficial needling, one study compared relaxation with paced respiration or placebo control (α-wave electroencephalographic biofeedback) and one study compared relaxation with no treatment. No evidence was found of a difference between relaxation and acupuncture or superficial needle insertion in the number of hot flushes per 24 hours (mean difference (MD) 0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.33 to 1.43, two studies, 72 participants, I2 = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Nor did any evidence suggest a difference between the two interventions in hot flush severity, measured using the Kupperman Index (MD -1.32, 95% CI -5.06 to 2.43, two studies, 72 participants, I2 = 0%; very low-quality evidence). The other two studies found no clear evidence of a difference in hot flush frequency between relaxation and paced respiration, placebo or no treatment. The data for these comparisons were unsuitable for analysis. None of these studies reported night sweats, sleep disturbances associated with night sweats or adverse effects as an outcome. The main limitations of identified evidence were lack of data, imprecision and failure to report study methods in adequate detail. Evidence is insufficient to show the effectiveness of relaxation techniques as treatment for menopausal vasomotor symptoms, or to determine whether this treatment is more effective than no treatment, placebo, acupuncture, superficial needle insertion or paced respiration.","We found four randomised controlled studies, with 281 participants.

CD005268,"Nine studies involving 1359 participants met the inclusion criteria. Six studies compared individual education to usual care and three compared individual education to group education (361 participants). There were no long-term studies and overall the quality of the studies was not high. In the six studies comparing individual face-to-face education to usual care, individual education did not significantly improve glycaemic control (weighted mean difference (WMD) in HbA1c -0.1% (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.3 to 0.1, P = 0.33) over a 12 to 18 month period. However, there did appear to be a significant benefit of individual education on glycaemic control in a subgroup analysis of three studies involving participants with a higher mean baseline HbA1c greater than 8% (WMD -0.3% (95% CI -0.5 to -0.1, P = 0.007). In the two studies comparing individual to group education, there was no significant difference in glycaemic control between individual or group education at 12 to 18 months with a WMD in HbA1c of 0.03% (95% CI -0.02 to 0.1, P = 0.22). There was no significant difference in the impact of individual versus usual care or group education on body mass index systolic or diastolic blood pressure. There were too few studies to perform a meta-analysis on the effect of individual education on dietary self management, diabetes knowledge, psychosocial outcomes and smoking habits. No data were available on the other main outcome measures of diabetes complications or health service utilization and cost analysis in these studies. This systematic review suggests a benefit of individual education on glycaemic control when compared with usual care in a subgroup of those with a baseline HbA1c greater than 8%. However, overall there did not appear to be a significant difference between individual education and usual care. In the small number of studies comparing group and individual education, there was an equal impact on HbA1c at 12 to 18 months. Additional studies are needed to delineate these findings further.","Nine studies involving 1359 participants met the inclusion criteria. Six studies compared individual education to usual care and three compared individual education to group education (361 participants). There were no long-term studies and overall the quality of the studies was not high. Individual face-to-face patient education for type 2 diabetes over a six to twelve month period did not significantly improve glycaemic control, body mass index (BMI - measure of overweight; body weight in kilogram divided through squared height in meters, kg/m2), blood pressure or total cholesterol in the short or medium term compared with usual care. However, there did appear to be a significant benefit of individual education on glycaemic control in a subgroup analysis of studies involving participants with a higher baseline HbA1c greater than 8% (that is, too high blood sugar levels over a couple of months or inadequate 'metabolic control'). In the studies comparing individual education to group education, there was no significant difference between individual or group education at 12 to 18 months nor a significant difference in the impact of individual education versus group education on BMI, systolic or diastolic blood pressure. However, descriptive evaluation suggested that there was no significant difference in quality of life, self management skills or knowledge between group and individual education. An exact analysis on dietary self management, diabetes knowledge, psychosocial outcomes and smoking habits could not be performed because there were limited studies and varied measurement tools. When comparing individual patient education to usual care, the limited number of studies available suggested a positive outcome on self management, smoking and knowledge, however there was conflicting evidence surrounding psychosocial outcomes. No data were available on the other main outcome measures of diabetes complications or health service utilization and cost analysis in these studies."
CD008572,"In total, we included 23 RCTs (N = 1309), 13 of which (56%) had low RoB. We included both men and women with a mean age of 50.6 years. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence as very low to moderate. Twelve studies examined suspected facet joint pain, five studies disc pain, two studies SI joint pain, two studies radicular CLBP, one study suspected radiating low back pain and one study CLBP with or without suspected radiation. Overall, moderate evidence suggests that facet joint RF denervation has a greater effect on pain compared with placebo over the short term (mean difference (MD) -1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.28 to -0.67). Low-quality evidence indicates that facet joint RF denervation is more effective than placebo for function over the short term (MD -5.53, 95% CI -8.66 to -2.40) and over the long term (MD -3.70, 95% CI -6.94 to -0.47). Evidence of very low to low quality shows that facet joint RF denervation is more effective for pain than steroid injections over the short (MD -2.23, 95% CI -2.38 to -2.08), intermediate (MD -2.13, 95% CI -3.45 to -0.81), and long term (MD -2.65, 95% CI -3.43 to -1.88). RF denervation used for disc pain produces conflicting results, with no effects for RF denervation compared with placebo over the short and intermediate term, and small effects for RF denervation over the long term for pain relief (MD -1.63, 95% CI -2.58 to -0.68) and improved function (MD -6.75, 95% CI -13.42 to -0.09). Lack of evidence of short-term effectiveness undermines the clinical plausibility of intermediate-term or long-term effectiveness. When RF denervation is used for SI joint pain, low-quality evidence reveals no differences from placebo in effects on pain (MD -2.12, 95% CI -5.45 to 1.21) and function (MD -14.06, 95% CI -30.42 to 2.30) over the short term, and one study shows a small effect on both pain and function over the intermediate term. RF denervation is an invasive procedure that can cause a variety of complications. The quality and size of original studies were inadequate to permit assessment of how often complications occur. The review authors found no high-quality evidence suggesting that RF denervation provides pain relief for patients with CLBP. Similarly, we identified no convincing evidence to show that this treatment improves function. Overall, the current evidence for RF denervation for CLBP is very low to moderate in quality; high-quality evidence is lacking. High-quality RCTs with larger patient samples are needed, as are data on long-term effects.","Both men and women, with a mean age of 50.6 years, were included. Moderate-quality evidence suggests that radiofrequency denervation might better relieve facet joint pain and improve function over the short term when compared with placebo. Evidence of very low to low quality shows that radiofrequency denervation might relieve facet joint pain as well as steroid injections. For patients with disc pain, only small long-term effects on pain relief and improved function are shown. For patients with SI joint pain, radiofrequency denervation had no effect over the short term and a smaller effect (based on one study) one to six months after treatment when compared with placebo. Radiofrequency denervation is an invasive procedure that can cause a variety of complications. The studies in this review were not of adequate quality and size to document how often complications occur. No high-quality evidence shows that radiofrequency denervation provides pain relief for patients with chronic low back pain. Similarly, no convincing evidence suggests that this treatment improves function. Given the poor quality of the evidence, large, high-quality studies are urgently needed to determine whether radiofrequency denervation is safe and effective."
CD004487,"Twenty-one trials met the inclusion criteria. A total of 2048 patients were initially enrolled in the trials (1148 received paracetamol, and 892 the placebo) and of these 1968 (96%) were included in the meta-analysis (1133 received paracetamol, and 835 the placebo). Paracetamol provided a statistically significant benefit when compared with placebo for pain relief and pain intensity at both 4 and 6 hours. Most studies were found to have moderate risk of bias, with poorly reported allocation concealment being the main problem. Risk ratio values for pain relief at 4 hours 2.85 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.89 to 4.29), and at 6 hours 3.32 (95% CI 1.88 to 5.87). A statistically significant benefit was also found between up to 1000 mg and 1000 mg doses, the higher the dose giving greater benefit for each measure at both time points. There was no statistically significant difference between the number of patients who reported adverse events, overall this being 19% in the paracetamol group and 16% in the placebo group. Paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.","Twenty-one trials (with over 2000 participants) were included.

There was no statistically significant difference between the number of patients who reported adverse events, overall this being 19% in the paracetamol group and 16% in the placebo group. However the review concludes that paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth."
CD000119,"We included nine trials involving 3137 participants. We did not identify any new trials for inclusion in this updated review. None of the studies reported data on the primary outcome in sufficient detail to enable analysis for the review. Overall, there was a moderate risk of bias in the included studies. Compared with UFH, there was no evidence of an effect of LMWH or heparinoids on death from all causes during the treatment period (96/1616 allocated LMWH/heparinoid versus 78/1486 allocated UFH; odds ratio (OR) 1.06, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.47; 8 trials, 3102 participants, low quality evidence). LMWH or heparinoid were associated with a significant reduction in deep vein thrombosis (DVT) compared with UFH (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.70, 7 trials, 2585 participants, low quality evidence). However, the number of the major clinical events such as pulmonary embolism (PE) and intracranial haemorrhage was too small to provide a reliable estimate of the effects. Treatment with a LMWH or heparinoid after acute ischaemic stroke appears to decrease the occurrence of DVT compared with standard UFH, but there are too few data to provide reliable information on their effects on other important outcomes, including functional outcome, death and intracranial haemorrhage.","We found nine trials involving 3137 participants; overall these trials had a moderate risk of bias (this means that the results are likely to be less credible than if the risk of bias was low). No new trials were included in this updated review. None of the studies reported reliable information on disability or recovery after stroke. Overall, there was a moderate risk of bias in the included studies. Compared with UFH, there was no evidence of an effect of LMWH or heparinoids on death from all causes during the treatment period (quality of the evidence was low). Although LMWH or heparinoid were associated with significantly fewer clots in leg veins (DVT) than UFH, the number of major events such as when a blood clot becomes lodged in an artery in the lung (pulmonary embolism) and bleeding inside the skull (intracranial haemorrhages) was too small to know whether the harms outweighed the benefits."
CD007168,"Searches identified 23 trials; nine trials (255 participants) are included, of these seven trials are more than 10 years old. Three trials of nebulized thiol derivatives were identified (one compared 20% N-acetylcysteine to 2% N-acetylcysteine; another compared sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulphonate to 7% hypertonic saline; and another compared glutathione to 4% hypertonic saline). Although generally well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, there was no evidence of significant clinical benefit in our primary outcomes in participants receiving these treatments. Six trials of oral thiol derivatives were identified. Three trials compared N-acetylcysteine to placebo; one compared N-acetylcysteine, ambroxol and placebo; one compared carbocysteine to ambroxol; and one compared low and high-dose N-acetylcysteine. Oral thiol derivatives were generally well-tolerated with no significant adverse effects, however there was no evidence of significant clinical benefit in our primary outcomes in participants receiving these treatments. We found no evidence to recommend the use of either nebulized or oral thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis. There are very few good quality trials investigating the effect of these medications in cystic fibrosis, and further research is required to investigate the potential role of these medications in improving the outcomes of people with cystic fibrosis.","Six included trials assessed the effects of oral thiol derivatives.Three of these trials compared oral N-acetylcysteine to placebo; one compared oral N-acetylcysteine, oral ambroxol and placebo; and one compared oral carbocysteine and oral ambroxol (no placebo).

In summary, the trials included in the review did not provide any evidence that nebulized or oral thiol derivatives were either beneficial or harmful to people with cystic fibrosis. Further research investigating the effects of thiol derivatives in people with cystic fibrosis is required before their use can be recommended."
CD011923,"We included four RCTs with 253 participants, all were at risk of bias. One unpublished study evaluated fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure, two studies evaluated fibrin glue as an adjunct to Limberg flap and one study evaluated fibrin glue as an adjunct to Karydakis flap. For fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure, there were no data available for the primary outcomes of time to healing and adverse events. There was low-quality evidence of less pain on day one after the procedure with fibrin glue monotherapy compared with Bascom's procedure (mean difference (MD) -2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.03 to -0.97) (evidence downgraded twice for risk of performance and detection bias). Fibrin glue may reduce the time taken to return to normal activities compared with Bascom's procedure (mean time 42 days with surgery and 7 days with glue, MD -34.80 days, 95% CI -66.82 days to -2.78 days) (very low-quality evidence, downgraded as above and for imprecision). Fibrin glue as an adjunct to the Limberg flap may reduce the healing time from 22 to 8 days compared with the Limberg flap alone (MD -13.95 days, 95% CI -16.76 days to -11.14 days) (very low-quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and imprecision). It is uncertain whether use of fibrin glue affects the incidence of postoperative seroma (an adverse event) (risk ratio (RR) 0.27, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.61; very low-quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and imprecision). There was low-quality evidence that fibrin glue, as an adjunct to Limberg flap, may reduce postoperative pain (median 2 versus 4; P < 0.001) and time to return to normal activities (median 8 days versus 17 days; P < 0.001). The addition of fibrin glue to the Limberg flap may reduce the length of hospital stay (MD -1.69 days, 95% CI -2.08 days to -1.29 days) (very low-quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and for unexplained heterogeneity). A single RCT evaluating fibrin glue as an adjunct to the Karydakis flap did not report data for the primary outcome of time to healing. It is uncertain whether fibrin glue with the Karydakis flap affects the incidence of postoperative seroma (adverse event) (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.67 to 13.46) (very low-quality evidence, downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias and for imprecision). Fibrin glue as an adjunct to Karydakis flap may reduce length of stay but this is highly uncertain (mean 2 days versus 3.7 days; P < 0.001, low-quality evidence downgraded twice for risk of selection, performance and detection bias). Current evidence is uncertain regarding any benefits associated with fibrin glue either as monotherapy or as an adjunct to surgery for people with pilonidal sinus disease. We identified only four RCTs and each was small and at risk of bias resulting in very low-quality evidence for the primary outcomes of time to healing and adverse events. Future studies should enrol many more participants, ensure adequate randomisation and blinding, whilst measuring clinically relevant outcomes.","We found four studies that included 253 participants, the majority of whom were male. Fibrin glue on its own was compared with surgery in one study. It is not known whether fibrin glue on its own affects time to healing and adverse events compared with a type of surgery (Bascom's procedure). Fibrin glue may result in less pain on the first day after the procedure compared with Bascom's procedure. When fibrin glue is used alongside a type of surgery called the Limberg flap it may reduce the healing time by approximately 14 days compared with the surgery on its own, however this finding is highly uncertain as the evidence is very low-quality. It is uncertain whether using the fibrin glue alongside the Limberg flap affects the incidence of a complication called seroma (a collection of fluid) but it may reduce postoperative pain (this evidence is low-quality and therefore quite uncertain) and may reduce time to return to normal activities (low-quality evidence) and length of hospital stay (this was very low-quality evidence and therefore very uncertain). One study evaluated the effect of adding fibrin glue to a type of surgery called the Karydakis flap. It is not clear from this study whether using the glue affects time to healing or the incidence of seroma. Using the fibrin glue with the Karydakis flap may reduce length of hospital stay compared with surgery alone but again this is low-quality evidence."
CD010015,"We included two RCTs in this review, in which 2343 participants with AMD were randomised to receive either omega 3 fatty acid supplements or a placebo. The trials, which had a low risk of bias, were conducted in the USA and France. Overall, there was no evidence that people who took omega 3 fatty acid supplements were at decreased (or increased risk) of progression to advanced AMD (pooled hazard ratio (HR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.84 to 1.10, high quality evidence). Similarly, people taking these supplements were no more (or less) likely to lose 15 or more letters of visual acuity (USA study HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.10; French study at 36 months risk ratio (RR) 1.25, 95% CI 0.69 to 2.26, participants = 230). The number of adverse events was similar in the intervention and placebo groups (USA study participants with one or more serious adverse event RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09, participants = 2080; French study total adverse events RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.13, participants = 263). This review found that omega 3 LCPUFA supplementation in people with AMD for periods up to five years does not reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD or the development of moderate to severe visual loss. No published randomised trials were identified on dietary omega 3 fatty acids for primary prevention of AMD. Currently available evidence does not support increasing dietary intake of omega 3 LCPUFA for the explicit purpose of preventing or slowing the progression of AMD.",We identified two trials with a total of 2343 participants. The trials were conducted in the USA and France and investigated the use of fish oil supplements in people with AMD who were at high risk of progressing to advanced disease. We judged the studies to be at low risk of bias. The incidence of adverse effects was similar in the intervention and placebo groups. These studies found that omega 3 supplementation for periods up to five years did not reduce the rate of progression to advanced AMD or reduce significant visual loss compared to a placebo.
CD003172,"Two trials met the inclusion criteria. The sponge was significantly less effective in both trials in preventing overall pregnancy than was the diaphragm. In the larger USA trial, the 12-month cumulative life-table termination rates per 100 women for overall pregnancy were 17.4 for the sponge and 12.8 for the diaphragm. The rates were 24.5 for the sponge and 10.9 for the diaphragm in the UK trial. Similarly, discontinuation rates at 12 months were higher with the sponge than with the diaphragm (Odds ratio 1.31; 95% CI 1.07 to 1.59). Allergic-type reactions were more common with the sponge, although discontinuation for discomfort differed in the two trials. No new trials have been identified since the initial review. The sponge was less effective than the diaphragm in preventing pregnancy. Discontinuation rates were higher at 12 months as well. Other randomized controlled trials will be needed to resolve the potential role of spermicides in preventing sexually transmitted infections or in causing adverse effects.","We found two trials. In a large USA trial, the sponge did not work as well as the diaphragm in preventing pregnancy. For every 100 women who used the sponge for a year, about 17 got pregnant. For each 100 women who used the sponge for a year, about 25 got pregnant. In April 2013, we did computer searches for randomized trials that compared the sponge with the diaphragm. We have not found any new trials since the initial review. About 30% more women stopped using the sponge than the diaphragm."
CD011427,"We selected 23 studies for inclusion (22 journal articles and one conference abstract). We evaluated the following scales: Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS; 11 studies), Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER; eight studies), Face Arm Speech Time (FAST; five studies), Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS; five studies), Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS; three studies), Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSST; one study), Medic Prehospital Assessment for Code Stroke (MedPACS; one study) and PreHospital Ambulance Stroke Test (PreHAST; one study). Nine studies compared the accuracy of two or more scales. We considered 12 studies at high risk of bias and one with applicability concerns in the patient selection domain; 14 at unclear risk of bias and one with applicability concerns in the reference standard domain; and the risk of bias in the flow and timing domain was high in one study and unclear in another 16. We pooled the results from five studies evaluating ROSIER in the ER and five studies evaluating LAPSS in a prehospital setting. The studies included in the meta-analysis of ROSIER were of relatively good methodologic quality and produced a summary sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI 0.84 to 0.91), with the prediction interval ranging from approximately 0.75 to 0.95. This means that the test will miss on average 12% of people with stroke/TIA which, depending on the circumstances, could range from 5% to 25%. We could not obtain a reliable summary estimate of specificity due to extreme heterogeneity in study-level results. The summary sensitivity of LAPSS was 0.83 (95% CI 0.75 to 0.89) and summary specificity 0.93 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.96). However, we were uncertain in the validity of these results as four of the studies were at high and one at uncertain risk of bias. We did not report summary estimates for the rest of the scales, as the number of studies per test per setting was small, the risk of bias was high or uncertain, the results were highly heterogenous, or a combination of these. Studies comparing two or more scales in the same participants reported that ROSIER and FAST had similar accuracy when used in the ER. In the field, CPSS was more sensitive than MedPACS and LAPSS, but had similar sensitivity to that of MASS; and MASS was more sensitive than LAPSS. In contrast, MASS, ROSIER and MedPACS were more specific than CPSS; and the difference in the specificities of MASS and LAPSS was not statistically significant. In the field, CPSS had consistently the highest sensitivity and, therefore, should be preferred to other scales. Further evidence is needed to determine its absolute accuracy and whether alternatives scales, such as MASS and ROSIER, which might have comparable sensitivity but higher specificity, should be used instead, to achieve better overall accuracy. In the ER, ROSIER should be the test of choice, as it was evaluated in more studies than FAST and showed consistently high sensitivity. In a cohort of 100 people of whom 62 have stroke/TIA, the test will miss on average seven people with stroke/TIA (ranging from three to 16). We were unable to obtain an estimate of its summary specificity. Because of the small number of studies per test per setting, high risk of bias, substantial differences in study characteristics and large between-study heterogeneity, these findings should be treated as provisional hypotheses that need further verification in better-designed studies.","We included 23 studies evaluating the following scales: Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS; 11 studies), Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER; eight studies), Face Arm Speech Time (FAST; five studies), Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Scale (LAPSS; five studies), Melbourne Ambulance Stroke Scale (MASS; three studies), Ontario Prehospital Stroke Screening Tool (OPSST; one study), Medic Prehospital Assessment for Code Stroke (MedPACS; one study) and PreHospital Ambulance Stroke Test (PreHAST; one study). Nine studies compared two or more scales in the same people. The results from five studies were combined to estimate the accuracy of ROSIER in the emergency room (ER) and five studies to estimate the accuracy of LAPSS when used by ambulance clinicians. The rest of the scales were evaluated in a smaller number of studies or the results were too variable to be combined statistically. A small number of studies compared two or more scales when applied to the same participants. They reported that in the ER, ROSIER and FAST had similar accuracy, but ROSIER was evaluated in more studies. Further research is needed to estimate the proportion of wrong results and whether alternatives scales, such as MASS and ROSIER, which might have comparable sensitivity but higher specificity, should be used instead to achieve better overall accuracy. In the ER, ROSIER should be the test of choice. In a group of 100 people of whom 62 have stroke/TIA, the test will miss on average seven people with stroke/TIA (ranging from three to 16). We were unable to obtain an estimate of specificity (how many people without stroke/TIA will test negative). Because of the small number of studies evaluating the tests in a specific setting, poor quality, substantial differences in study characteristics and variability in results, these findings should be treated with caution and need further verification in better-designed studies."
CD002840,"We included 56 trials with 3105 participants in this updated review. The average age of the participants was 60 years, and the studies were carried out in both inpatient and outpatient settings. All participants had at least some walking difficulties and many could not walk without assistance. Overall, the use of treadmill training did not increase the chances of walking independently compared with other physiotherapy interventions (risk difference (RD) -0.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.02; 18 trials, 1210 participants; P = 0.94; I² = 0%; low-quality evidence). Overall, the use of treadmill training in walking rehabilitation for people after stroke increased the walking velocity and walking endurance significantly. The pooled mean difference (MD) (random-effects model) for walking velocity was 0.06 m/s (95% CI 0.03 to 0.09; 47 trials, 2323 participants; P < 0.0001; I² = 44%; moderate-quality evidence) and the pooled MD for walking endurance was 14.19 metres (95% CI 2.92 to 25.46; 28 trials, 1680 participants; P = 0.01; I² = 27%; moderate-quality evidence). Overall, the use of treadmill training with body weight support in walking rehabilitation for people after stroke did not increase the walking velocity and walking endurance at the end of scheduled follow-up. The pooled MD (random-effects model) for walking velocity was 0.03 m/s (95% CI -0.05 to 0.10; 12 trials, 954 participants; P = 0.50; I² = 55%; low-quality evidence) and the pooled MD for walking endurance was 21.64 metres (95% CI -4.70 to 47.98; 10 trials, 882 participants; P = 0.11; I² = 47%; low-quality evidence). In 38 studies with a total of 1571 participants who were independent in walking at study onset, the use of treadmill training increased the walking velocity significantly. The pooled MD (random-effects model) for walking velocity was 0.08 m/s (95% CI 0.05 to 0.12; P < 0.00001; I2 = 49%). There were insufficient data to comment on any effects on quality of life or activities of daily living. Adverse events and dropouts did not occur more frequently in people receiving treadmill training and these were not judged to be clinically serious events. Overall, people after stroke who receive treadmill training, with or without body weight support, are not more likely to improve their ability to walk independently compared with people after stroke not receiving treadmill training, but walking speed and walking endurance may improve slightly in the short term. Specifically, people with stroke who are able to walk (but not people who are dependent in walking at start of treatment) appear to benefit most from this type of intervention with regard to walking speed and walking endurance. This review did not find, however, that improvements in walking speed and endurance may have persisting beneficial effects. Further research should specifically investigate the effects of different frequencies, durations, or intensities (in terms of speed increments and inclination) of treadmill training, as well as the use of handrails, in ambulatory participants, but not in dependent walkers.","We identified 56 relevant trials, involving 3105 participants, up to March 2017. The average age of the participants was 60 years, and the studies were carried out in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The quality of evidence for treadmill training for walking after stroke was low to moderate. Unwanted events such as falls and dropouts were not more common in people receiving treadmill training. People after stroke who receive treadmill training with or without body weight support are not more likely to improve their ability to walk independently. However, treadmill training with or without body weight support may improve walking speed and walking capacity compared with people not receiving treadmill training. More specifically, people after stroke who are able to walk at the start of therapy appear to benefit most from this type of intervention, but people who are not able to walk independently at therapy onset do not benefit. This review found that improvements in walking speed and endurance in people who can walk have no lasting positive effect. Further research should specifically investigate the effects of different frequencies, durations or intensities (in terms of speed increments and inclination) of treadmill training, as well as the use of handrails."

The use of TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies produced inconclusive evidence that TTM SOC interventions led to sustained weight loss (the mean difference between intervention and control groups varied from 2.1 kg to 0.2 kg at 24 months; 2971 participants; 3 trials; low quality evidence). Following application of TTM SOC there were improvements in physical activity and dietary habits, such as increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced dietary fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption (very low quality evidence). Weight gain was reported as an adverse event in one of the included trials. None of the trials reported health-related quality of life, morbidity, or economic costs as outcomes. The small number of studies and their variable methodological quality limit the applicability of the findings to clinical practice. The main limitations include inadequate reporting of outcomes and the methods for allocation, randomisation and blinding; extensive use of self-reported measures to estimate the effects of interventions on a number of outcomes, including weight loss, dietary consumption and physical activity levels; and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to lack of post-intervention assessments. The evidence to support the use of TTM SOC in weight loss interventions is limited by risk of bias and imprecision, not allowing firm conclusions to be drawn. When combined with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions we found very low quality evidence that it might lead to better dietary and physical activity habits. This systematic review highlights the need for well-designed RCTs that apply the principles of the TTM SOC appropriately to produce conclusive evidence about the effect of TTM SOC lifestyle interventions on weight loss and other health outcomes.","Altogether the studies evaluated 2971 participants, with 1467 participants allocated to the intervention groups and 1504 to the control groups. The studies had a length of intervention of 9, 12 and 24 months. The use of the TTM SOC in combination with diet or physical activity, or both, and other interventions in the included studies provided inconclusive evidence about the impact of such interventions on sustainable weight loss (mean difference in favour of the TTM SOC was between 2.1 kg and 0.2 kg at 24 months). However, other positive effects were noted, such as changes in physical activity and dietary habits that included increased exercise duration and frequency, reduced fat intake and increased fruit and vegetable consumption. The studies did not report other important outcomes such as health-related quality of life, illness (morbidity) and economic costs. The main limitations included incomplete reporting of outcomes, methodological shortcomings, extensive use of self-reported measures and insufficient assessment of sustainability due to the lack of long-term assessments. Overall, the quality of the evidence was low or very low."
CD009338,"We have included data from 27 randomised trials involving 12,256 women. All of the trials examined telephone support versus usual care (no additional telephone support). We did not identify any trials comparing different modes of telephone support (for example, text messaging versus one-to-one calls). All but one of the trials were carried out in high-resource settings. The majority of studies examined support provided via telephone conversations between women and health professionals although a small number of trials included telephone support from peers. In two trials women received automated text messages. Many of the interventions aimed to address specific health problems and collected data on behavioural outcomes such as smoking cessation and relapse (seven trials) or breastfeeding continuation (seven trials). Other studies examined support interventions aimed at women at high risk of postnatal depression (two trials) or preterm birth (two trials); the rest of the interventions were designed to offer women more general support and advice. For most of our pre-specified outcomes few studies contributed data, and many of the results described in the review are based on findings from only one or two studies. Overall, results were inconsistent and inconclusive although there was some evidence that telephone support may be a promising intervention. Results suggest that telephone support may increase women's overall satisfaction with their care during pregnancy and the postnatal period, although results for both periods were derived from only two studies. There was no consistent evidence confirming that telephone support reduces maternal anxiety during pregnancy or after the birth of the baby, although results on anxiety outcomes were not easy to interpret as data were collected at different time points using a variety of measurement tools. There was evidence from two trials that women at high risk of depression who received support had lower mean depression scores in the postnatal period, although there was no clear evidence that women who received support were less likely to have a diagnosis of depression. Results from trials offering breastfeeding telephone support were also inconsistent, although the evidence suggests that telephone support may increase the duration of breastfeeding. There was no strong evidence that women receiving telephone support were less likely to be smoking at the end of pregnancy or during the postnatal period. For infant outcomes, such as preterm birth and infant birthweight, overall, there was little evidence. Where evidence was available, there were no clear differences between groups. Results from two trials suggest that babies whose mothers received support may have been less likely to have been admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), although it is not easy to understand the mechanisms underpinning this finding. Despite some encouraging findings, there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine telephone support for women accessing maternity services, as the evidence from included trials is neither strong nor consistent. Although benefits were found in terms of reduced depression scores, breastfeeding duration and increased overall satisfaction, the current trials do not provide strong enough evidence to warrant investment in resources.","In this review we have included results from 27 randomised trials with more than 12,000 women.

CD000216,"Four trials (five articles) met the inclusion criteria of this review; three were RCTs and one was a quasi-RCT; and included a total of 280 participants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990. The studies were sufficiently similar regarding the research question they asked and the interventions that we could combine the trials to assess the effect of the intervention. Meta-analysis showed that the intervention produced no significant difference when compared to conservative management for the outcomes of: placement of hydrocephalus shunt (typical risk ratio (RR) 0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.26; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), death (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.44; 4 trials, 280 infants; I² statistic = 0%; low quality evidence), major disability in survivors (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.18; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 11%; high quality evidence), multiple disability in survivors (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.24; 2 trials, 141 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or disability (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.14; 2 trials, 180 infants; I² statistic = 0%; high quality evidence), death or shunt (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.11; 3 trials, 233 infants; I² statistic = 0%; moderate quality evidence), and infection of CSF presurgery (RR 1.73, 95% CI 0.53 to 5.67; 2 trials, 195 infants; low quality evidence). We assessed the quality of the evidence as high for the outcomes of major disability, multiple disability, and disability or death. We rated the evidence for the outcomes of shunt insertion, and death or shunt insertion as of moderate quality as one included trial used an alternation method of randomisation. For the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery, the quality of the evidence was low as one trial used an alternation method, the number of participants was too low to assess the objectives with sufficient precision, and there was inconsistency regarding the findings in the included trials regarding the outcome of infection of CSF presurgery. There was no evidence that repeated removal of CSF via lumbar puncture, ventricular puncture or from a ventricular reservoir produces any benefit over conservative management in neonates with or at risk for developing PHH in terms of reduction of disability, death, or need for placement of a permanent shunt.","We included four trials that included a total of 280 preterm infants treated in neonatal intensive care units in the UK. The trials were published between 1980 and 1990. We assessed the outcomes of major disability, multiple disability, and disability or death as high quality evidence. We recorded the quality of the evidence for the outcomes of shunt insertion, and death or shunt insertion as low quality evidence, as there was an issue with the random allocation method in one included trial that reported on this outcome. For the outcomes of death and infection of CSF presurgery, the quality of the evidence was moderate due to the previously mentioned problem with allocation. In the case of the outcome infection of CSF presurgery, the results were inconsistent between the included trials. We found no evidence that removal of CSF by lumbar or ventricular taps reduces the need for a permanent shunt to be inserted. There was also no evidence that it reduced the risk of major disability, multiple disability, or death."
CD010508,"Nine RCTs, one with two reports, (N = 531 participants, 469 included in analyses) investigated a variety of telerehabilitation interventions in adults with MS. The mean age of participants varied from 41 to 52 years (mean 46.5 years) and mean years since diagnosis from 7.7 to 19.0 years (mean 12.3 years). The majority of the participants were women (proportion ranging from 56% to 87%, mean 74%) and with a relapsing-remitting course of MS. These interventions were complex, with more than one rehabilitation component and included physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes. All studies scored 'low' on the methodological quality assessment. Overall, the review found 'low-level' evidence for telerehabilitation interventions in reducing short-term disability and symptoms such as fatigue. There was also 'low-level' evidence supporting telerehabilitation in the longer term for improved functional activities, impairments (such as fatigue, pain, insomnia); and participation measured by quality of life and psychological outcomes. There were limited data on process evaluation (participants'/therapists' satisfaction) and no data available for cost effectiveness. There were no adverse events reported as a result of telerehabilitation interventions. There is currently limited evidence on the efficacy of telerehabilitation in improving functional activities, fatigue and quality of life in adults with MS. A range of telerehabilitation interventions might be an alternative method of delivering services in MS populations. There is insufficient evidence to support on what types of telerehabilitation interventions are effective, and in which setting. More robust trials are needed to build evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of these interventions.","We found nine relevant RCTs covering 531 participants (469 included in the analyses), evaluating a wide variety of telerehabilitation interventions in persons with MS. The telerehabilitation interventions evaluated were complex, with more than one rehabilitation component and included physical activity, educational, behavioural and symptom management programmes. The methodological quality of the included studies is low and varied among the studies. This review looked for evidence on how telerehabilitation interventions work in adults with MS. We searched widely for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), a particular kind of study where participants are placed in treatment groups by chance (that is, randomly) because in most settings these provide the highest quality evidence. There was 'low-quality' evidence from the included RCTs to support the benefit of telerehabilitation in reducing short-term disability and managing symptoms such as fatigue in adults with MS. We found limited evidence to support the benefit of telerehabilitation interventions in improving disability, reducing symptoms and improving quality of life in the longer term. No studies reported any serious harm from telerehabilitation and there was no information on the associated costs. There is a need for further research to assess the effects of the range of telerehabilitation techniques and to establish the clinical and cost effectiveness of these interventions in people with MS."
CD004752,"Four RCTs were included in the review (416 women). The trials compared glucocorticoid supplementation during IVF stimulation versus placebo. Two of the studies had data in a form that we could not enter into analysis, so results include data from only two trials (310) women. For the outcome of live birth, data were available for only 212 women, as the larger study had data available from only one study centre. One of the studies gave inadequate description of randomisation methods, but the other was at low risk of bias in all domains. The evidence was rated as low or very low quality for all outcomes, mainly due to imprecision, with low sample sizes and few events. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in live birth rate (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.45 to 2.58; 2 RCTs, n = 212, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence). Our findings suggest that if the chance of live birth with placebo is assumed to be 15%, the chance following supplementation would be between 7% and 31%. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in the clinical pregnancy rate (OR 1.69, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.90; 2 RCTs, n = 310, I2 = 0%, low-quality evidence).The evidence suggests that if the chance of clinical pregnancy with placebo is assumed to be 24%, the chance following treatment with glucocorticoid supplementation would be between 23% and 47%. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in multiple-pregnancy rate (OR 3.32 , 95% CI 0.12 to 91.60; 1 RCT , n = 20, very low-quality evidence) or miscarriage rate (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.05 to 18.57; 1 RCT, n = 20, very low-quality evidence). Neither of the studies reported OHSS or side-effects. The safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI cycles (until the day of oocyte retrieval) is unclear due to the small number of studies and low event rates. Whilst glucocorticoids possibly increase the clinical pregnancy rate, there may be little or no impact on live birth rate. More research is needed.","The trials compared adjuvant treatment with systemic glucocorticoids during ovarian stimulation for IVF cycles versus no placebo. Key results
Two RCTs were included in our analyses (310 women). For the outcome of live birth, data were available for only 212 women, as the larger study had data available from only one study centre. The evidence was rated as low or very low quality for all outcomes, mainly due to imprecision, with low sample sizes and few events. Our findings suggest that if the chance of live birth with placebo is assumed to be 15%, the chance following supplementation would be between 7% and 31%, and that if the chance of clinical pregnancy with placebo is assumed to be 24%, the chance following treatment with supplementation would be between 23% and 47%. There was no conclusive evidence of a difference in the primary outcome of live birth rate and the secondary outcome of clinical pregnancy rate. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether there was any difference between the groups in the multiple-pregnancy rate or miscarriage rate. Neither of the studies reported ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) or side-effects. Thus, the safety and effectiveness of glucocorticoid administration in women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for IVF/ICSI cycles (until the day of oocyte retrieval) is unclear due to the small number of studies and low event rates. Whilst glucocorticoids possibly increase the clinical pregnancy rate, there may be little or no impact on the live birth rate."
CD012055,"We identified seven completed trials (472 participants), and four ongoing trials (recruiting 837 participants) which are due to be completed by December 2020. Of the seven completed trials, five trials (456 participants) compared a TPO mimetic versus placebo (four romiplostim trials, and one eltrombopag trial), one trial (eight participants) compared DDAVP with placebo and one trial (eight participants) compared tranexamic acid with placebo. In the DDAVP trial, the only outcome reported was the bleeding time. In the tranexamic acid trial there were methodological flaws and bleeding definitions were subject to significant bias. Consequently, these trials could not be incorporated into the quantitative synthesis. No randomised trial of artificial platelet substitutes, platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, rFVIIa, rFXIII, rIL6 or rIL11 was identified. We assessed all five trials of TPO mimetics included in this review to be at high risk of bias because the trials were funded by the manufacturers of the TPO mimetics and the authors had financial stakes in the sponsoring companies. The GRADE quality of the evidence was very low to moderate across the different outcomes. There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in the number of participants with at least one bleeding episode between TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.31, four trials, 206 participants, low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in the risk of a life-threatening bleed between those treated with a TPO mimetic and placebo (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.04 to 2.26, one trial, 39 participants, low-quality evidence). There was insufficient evidence to detect a difference in the risk of all-cause mortality between those treated with a TPO mimetic and placebo (RR 0.74, 95%CI 0.52 to 1.05, five trials, 456 participants, very low-quality evidence). There was a significant reduction in the number of participants receiving any platelet transfusion between those treated with TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.95, four trials, 206 participants, moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence for a difference in the incidence of transfusion reactions between those treated with TPO mimetics and placebo (pOR 0.06, 95% CI 0.00 to 3.44, one trial, 98 participants, very low-quality evidence). There was no evidence for a difference in thromboembolic events between TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 1.41, 95%CI 0.39 to 5.01, five trials, 456 participants, very-low quality evidence). There was no evidence for a difference in drug reactions between TPO mimetics and placebo (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.51, five trials, 455 participants, low-quality evidence). No trial reported the number of days of bleeding per participant, platelet transfusion episodes, mean red cell transfusions per participant, red cell transfusion episodes, transfusion-transmitted infections, formation of antiplatelet antibodies or platelet refractoriness. In order to demonstrate a reduction in bleeding events from 26 in 100 to 16 in 100 participants, a study would need to recruit 514 participants (80% power, 5% significance). There is insufficient evidence at present for thrombopoietin (TPO) mimetics for the prevention of bleeding for people with thrombocytopenia due to chronic bone marrow failure. There is no randomised controlled trial evidence for artificial platelet substitutes, platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, rFVIIa, rFXIII or rIL6 or rIL11, antifibrinolytics or DDAVP in this setting.","The four ongoing trials are all comparing TPO mimetics versus placebo; they are expected to recruit 837 participants in total and are due to be completed by December 2020. Of the seven completed trials, five trials (456 participants) assessed TPO mimetics, one trial (eight participants) assessed tranexamic acid and one trial (eight participants) assessed DDAVP. The trial of DDAVP only assessed the bleeding time: the time taken for bleeding to stop after a small cut is made in the participant's forearm. The trial of tranexamic acid had significant methodological flaws in the way bleeding was reported. Consequently, quantitative analysis was only performed on the five trials assessing TPO mimetics. No randomised trial of artificial platelet substitutes, platelet-poor plasma, fibrinogen concentrate, rFVIIa, rFXIII, rIL6 or rIL11 was identified. We assessed all five trials of TPO mimetics included in this review to be at high risk as the manufacturers if the TPO mimetics were directly involved in the design and publication of the trials. The quality of the evidence was low or very low for all outcomes except the number of participants receiving a platelet transfusion which was moderate-quality evidence. We are very uncertain whether TPO mimetics reduce the risk of mortality. TPO mimetics probably reduce the number of participants who need a platelet transfusion. No trial reported the number of days bleeding per participant, platelet transfusion episodes, mean red cell transfusions per participant, red cell transfusion episodes, transfusion-transmitted infections, formation of antiplatelet antibodies or platelet refractoriness."
MR000028,"In total, 48,814 studies were identified and the titles and abstracts were screened in duplicate. In this updated review, we identified an additional 124 methodological studies published in the 10 years since the first version of this review, which included 34 studies. Thus, 158 methodological studies met our criteria for inclusion. The methods used by these studies focused on evidence relevant to populations experiencing health inequity (108 out of 158 studies), assess subgroup analysis across PROGRESS-Plus (26 out of 158 studies), assess analysis of a gradient in effect across PROGRESS-Plus (2 out of 158 studies) or use a combination of subgroup analysis and focused approaches (20 out of 158 studies). The most common PROGRESS-Plus factors assessed were age (43 studies), socioeconomic status in 35 studies, low- and middle-income countries in 24 studies, gender or sex in 22 studies, race or ethnicity in 17 studies, and four studies assessed multiple factors across which health inequity may exist. Only 16 studies provided a definition of health inequity. Five methodological approaches to consider health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness were identified: 1) descriptive assessment of reporting and analysis in systematic reviews (140 of 158 studies used a type of descriptive method); 2) descriptive assessment of reporting and analysis in original trials (50 studies); 3) analytic approaches which assessed differential effects across one or more PROGRESS-Plus factors (16 studies); 4) applicability assessment (25 studies) and 5) stakeholder engagement (28 studies), which is a new finding in this update and examines the appraisal of whether relevant stakeholders with lived experience of health inequity were included in the design of systematic reviews or design and delivery of interventions. Reporting for both approaches (analytic and applicability) lacked transparency and was insufficiently detailed to enable the assessment of credibility. There is a need for improvement in conceptual clarity about the definition of health equity, describing sufficient detail about analytic approaches (including subgroup analyses) and transparent reporting of judgments required for applicability assessments in order to consider health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness.","This updated review includes 158 collections of systematic reviews: 108 focused on evidence relevant to populations experiencing inequity, 26 assessed subgroup analysis across PROGRESS-Plus, two assessed analysis of a gradient in effect across PROGRESS-Plus and 20 used a combination of subgroup analysis and focused approaches. The most common PROGRESS-Plus factors assessed were age (43 studies), socioeconomic status (35 studies), low- and middle-income countries (24 studies). Four studies assessed multiple factors across which health inequity may exist. We identified five methodological approaches to consider health equity in systematic reviews of effectiveness: 1) descriptive assessment in the reviews, 2) descriptive assessment of the studies included in the reviews, 3) analytic approaches, 4) applicability assessment, and 5) stakeholder engagement. Analysis of effects for specific populations need to be justified and reported appropriately to allow assessment of their credibility. Transparency of judgments about applicability and relevance to disadvantaged populations needs to be improved."
CD013582,"We found 36 relevant studies and sampled 20 of these studies for our analysis. Ten of these studies were from Asia, four from Africa, four from Central and North America and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), H1N1, MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome), tuberculosis (TB), or seasonal influenza. Most of these healthcare workers worked in hospitals; others worked in primary and community care settings. The review points to several barriers and facilitators that influenced healthcare workers’ ability to adhere to IPC guidelines. The following factors are based on findings assessed as of moderate to high confidence. Healthcare workers felt unsure as to how to adhere to local guidelines when they were lengthy and ambiguous or did not reflect national or international guidelines. They could feel overwhelmed because local guidelines were constantly changing. They also described how IPC strategies led to increased workloads and fatigue, for instance because they had to use PPE and take on additional cleaning. Healthcare workers described how their responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the level of support they felt that they received from their management team. Clear communication about IPC guidelines was seen as vital. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They also thought it was a problem when training was not mandatory. Sufficient space to isolate patients was also seen as vital. A lack of isolation rooms, anterooms and shower facilities was identified as a problem. Other important practical measures described by healthcare workers included minimising overcrowding, fast-tracking infected patients, restricting visitors, and providing easy access to handwashing facilities. A lack of PPE, and provision of equipment that was of poor quality, was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. They also pointed to the need to adjust the volume of supplies as infection outbreaks continued. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw its value. Some healthcare workers felt motivated to follow the guidance because of fear of infecting themselves or their families, or because they felt responsible for their patients. Some healthcare workers found it difficult to use masks and other equipment when it made patients feel isolated, frightened or stigmatised. Healthcare workers also found masks and other equipment uncomfortable to use. The workplace culture could also influence whether healthcare workers followed IPC guidelines or not. Across many of the findings, healthcare workers pointed to the importance of including all staff, including cleaning staff, porters, kitchen staff and other support staff when implementing IPC guidelines. Healthcare workers point to several factors that influence their ability and willingness to follow IPC guidelines when managing respiratory infectious diseases. These include factors tied to the guideline itself and how it is communicated, support from managers, workplace culture, training, physical space, access to and trust in personal protective equipment, and a desire to deliver good patient care. The review also highlights the importance of including all facility staff, including support staff, when implementing IPC guidelines.","We analysed 20 studies. Ten studies were from Asia, four each from Africa and North and Central America, and two from Australia. The studies explored the views and experiences of nurses, doctors and other healthcare workers when dealing with SARS, H1N1 (‘swine flu’), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), tuberculosis or seasonal influenza. Most healthcare workers worked in hospitals. Our review pointed to several factors that influenced healthcare workers’ adherence to IPC guidelines. We judged the following findings to be well supported or very well supported (moderate to high confidence) by the studies we found. Healthcare workers were unsure whether to follow local guidelines if they differed from national or international guidance. They struggled to follow long or unclear guidelines, especially if their advice was impractical or kept changing. Use of PPE and additional cleaning meant that following IPC guidelines increased workload and fatigue. Healthcare workers’ responses to IPC guidelines were influenced by the support they received from management and their workplace culture. Healthcare workers emphasised the importance of clear communication about IPC guidelines. But healthcare workers pointed to a lack of training about the infection itself and about how to use PPE. They thought it was a problem when training was not compulsory and believed all staff, including cleaners, porters, kitchen and other support staff, should be included in IPC training. Insufficient space to isolate patients, and lack of anterooms, showers and easy access to handwashing facilities was a problem. Practical measures, such as minimising overcrowding, fast-tracking infected patients and restricting visitors were important for reducing infection. Lack of, and poor-quality, PPE was a serious concern for healthcare workers and managers. Supplies need to be adjusted as infection outbreaks continue. Healthcare workers believed that they followed IPC guidance more closely when they saw its value, for example, reducing the risk of infecting themselves and their families, or protecting their patients. Healthcare workers found PPE uncomfortable to use and some found PPE made patients feel isolated and frightened. Many factors affect healthcare workers’ willingness and ability to follow IPC guidelines. Our review includes a set of questions drawn from our findings to help healthcare providers plan, implement, or manage IPC strategies to help their workers follow IPC guidelines."
CD011276,"We included two trials enrolling 624 women in the review. It is uncertain whether breast surgery improves overall survival as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low (HR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.31; 2 studies; 624 women). The two studies did not report quality of life. Breast surgery may improve local progression-free survival (HR 0.22, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.57; 2 studies; 607 women; low-quality evidence), while it probably worsened distant progression-free survival (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.86; 1 study; 350 women; moderate-quality evidence). The two included studies did not measure breast cancer-specific survival. Toxicity from local therapy was reported by 30-day mortality and did not appear to differ between the two groups (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.14 to 6.90; 1 study; 274 women; low-quality evidence). Based on existing evidence from two randomised clinical trials, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions on the benefits and risks of breast surgery associated with systemic treatment for women diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. Until the ongoing clinical trials are finalised, the decision to perform breast surgery in these women should be individualised and shared between the physician and the patient considering the potential risks, benefits, and costs of each intervention.","We included only randomised clinical trials, as they are considered to be the best type of scientific study to answer questions about treatment, that compared the survival of women undergoing breast surgery combined with medical treatment versus medical treatment alone. We identified and included two randomised controlled trials involving a total of 624 women: 311 women underwent breast surgery plus medical treatment, and 313 women only received medical treatment. The review authors are uncertain whether breast surgery improves overall survival as the quality of the evidence has been assessed as very low. The included studies did not report any information relating to quality of life. Breast surgery may improve the control of local disease but it probably worsened control at distant sites. The two included studies did not measure breast cancer-specific survival. Toxicity from local therapy appeared to be the same in the group undergoing breast surgery combined with medical treatment and in the group receiving only medical treatment. It is not possible to make definitive conclusions about the benefits of breast surgery associated with medical treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer. The decision to perform surgery in such cases should be individualised and shared between the physician and the patient, considering the potential risks and benefits involved in this choice."
CD003906,"Primary outcome measure: one cross-over trial including 18 participants showed after four weeks, 2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.9 to 3.1) points more improvement on an 11-point disability scale with plasma exchange (10 exchanges over four weeks) than with sham exchange. Rapid deterioration after plasma exchange occurred in eight of 12 who had improved. Secondary outcome measures: when we combined the results of this cross-over trial and a trial with 29 participants treated in a parallel-group design, there were 31 points (95% CI 18 to 45) more improvement on an impairment scale (maximum score 280) after plasma exchange (six exchanges over three weeks) than after sham exchange. There were significant improvements in both trials in an electrophysiological measure, the proximally evoked compound muscle action potential, after three or four weeks. Non-randomised evidence indicates that plasma exchange induces adverse events in 3% to 17% of procedures. These events are sometimes serious. Both trials had a low risk of bias. A trial that showed no significant difference in the benefit between plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin is included in the Cochrane review of intravenous immunoglobulin for this condition. Moderate- to high-quality evidence from two small trials shows that plasma exchange provides significant short-term improvement in disability, clinical impairment, and motor nerve conduction velocity in CIDP but rapid deterioration may occur afterwards. Adverse events related to difficulty with venous access, use of citrate, and haemodynamic changes are not uncommon. We need more research to identify agents that will prolong the beneficial action of plasma exchange.","The cross-over trial showed on average two points more improvement on an 11-point disability scale with plasma exchange than sham exchange. When we combined the results of both trials, plasma exchange produced significantly more improvement in severity of disease signs measured by neurologists than sham exchange. According to non-randomised evidence, plasma exchange causes adverse events in 3% to 17% of procedures. These are sometimes serious. We considered both trials at low risk of bias, which means largely free of flaws that could have influenced the results. Another Cochrane review includes a trial showing similar improvement after plasma exchange to that after intravenous infusion of immunoglobulin (the antibody portion of blood). Because of the small size of the only trial reporting changes in disability, the quality of the evidence that plasma exchange reduces disability is moderate. The quality of the evidence that plasma exchange improves the signs of disease measured by a neurologist is high."
CD004684,"We included eleven randomised controlled trials involving 444 people, none of which were of high methodological quality. A large number of trials were excluded, mainly because of their non-randomised design. The randomisation procedures were either unclear or inadequate, using coin tossing, alternation, drawing lots or cards, or open tables of random numbers. The interventions and outcomes were too heterogeneous to be entered in a meta-analysis. Most trials examined a short-term effect up to six months after final treatment. There appeared to be a short-term effect of approximately 50% hair reduction with alexandrite and diode lasers up to six months after treatment, whereas little evidence was obtained for an effect of intense pulsed light, neodymium:YAG or ruby lasers. Long-term hair removal was not documented with any treatment. Pain, skin redness, swelling, burned hairs and pigmentary changes were infrequently reported adverse effects. Some treatments lead to temporary short-term hair removal. High quality research is needed on the effect of laser and photoepilation.","Eleven randomised controlled trials were included in the review, none of which were of high quality.

CD007868,"We included 96 studies published between 1955 and 2014 in this updated review. Seven studies with 11,356 randomised participants (7047 evaluated) reported the effects of fluoride toothpaste up to 1500 ppm on the primary dentition; one study with 2500 randomised participants (2008 evaluated) reported the effects of 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste on the primary and permanent dentition; 85 studies with 48,804 randomised participants (40,066 evaluated) reported the effects of toothpaste up to 2400 ppm on the immature permanent dentition; and three studies with 2675 randomised participants (2162 evaluated) reported the effects of up to 1100 ppm fluoride toothpaste on the mature permanent dentition. Follow-up in most studies was 36 months. In the primary dentition of young children, 1500 ppm fluoride toothpaste reduces caries increment when compared with non-fluoride toothpaste (MD -1.86 dfs, 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.51 to -1.21; 998 participants, one study, moderate-certainty evidence); the caries-preventive effects for the head-to-head comparison of 1055 ppm versus 550 ppm fluoride toothpaste are similar (MD -0.05, dmfs, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.28; 1958 participants, two studies, moderate-certainty evidence), but toothbrushing with 1450 ppm fluoride toothpaste slightly reduces decayed, missing, filled teeth (dmft) increment when compared with 440 ppm fluoride toothpaste (MD -0.34, dmft, 95%CI -0.59 to -0.09; 2362 participants, one study, moderate-certainty evidence). The certainty of the remaining evidence for this comparison was judged to be low. We included 81 studies in the network meta-analysis of D(M)FS increment in the permanent dentition of children and adolescents. The network included 21 different comparisons of seven fluoride concentrations. The certainty of the evidence was judged to be low with the following exceptions: there was high- and moderate-certainty evidence that 1000 to 1250 ppm or 1450 to 1500 ppm fluoride toothpaste reduces caries increments when compared with non-fluoride toothpaste (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.32 to -0.25, 55 studies; and SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.43 to -0.29, four studies); there was moderate-certainty evidence that 1450 to 1500 ppm fluoride toothpaste slightly reduces caries increments when compared to 1000 to 1250 ppm (SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.14 to -0.01, 10 studies); and moderate-certainty evidence that the caries increments are similar for 1700 to 2200 ppm and 2400 to 2800 ppm fluoride toothpaste when compared to 1450 to 1500 ppm (SMD 0.04, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.15, indirect evidence only; SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.14 to 0.05, two studies). In the adult permanent dentition, 1000 or 1100 ppm fluoride toothpaste reduces DMFS increment when compared with non-fluoride toothpaste in adults of all ages (MD -0.53, 95% CI -1.02 to -0.04; 2162 participants, three studies, moderate-certainty evidence). The evidence for DMFT was low certainty. Only a minority of studies assessed adverse effects of toothpaste. When reported, effects such as soft tissue damage and tooth staining were minimal. This Cochrane Review supports the benefits of using fluoride toothpaste in preventing caries when compared to non-fluoride toothpaste. Evidence for the effects of different fluoride concentrations is more limited, but a dose-response effect was observed for D(M)FS in children and adolescents. For many comparisons of different concentrations the caries-preventive effects and our confidence in these effect estimates are uncertain and could be challenged by further research. The choice of fluoride toothpaste concentration for young children should be balanced against the risk of fluorosis.","It includes 96 studies published between 1955 and 2014: seven studies with 11,356 randomised participants reported the effects of fluoride toothpaste up to 1500 ppm on the primary teeth; one study with 2500 randomised participants reported the effects of 1450 ppm toothpaste on the primary and permanent dentition; 85 studies with 48,804 randomised participants reported the effects of toothpaste up to 2400 ppm on the permanent teeth of children up to 18 years of age; and three studies with 2675 randomised participants reported the effects of up to 1100 ppm toothpaste on the permanent teeth of adults. Most studies assessed decay after participants had been using the toothpastes for 36 months. In primary teeth of young children, brushing teeth with a toothpaste containing 1500 ppm fluoride reduced the amount of new decay when compared with non-fluoride toothpaste; the amount of new decay was similar with 1055 ppm compared with 550 ppm fluoride toothpaste; and there was a slight reduction in the amount of new decay with 1450 ppm toothpaste compared with 440 ppm fluoride toothpaste. We present below findings for which there is moderate- or high-certainty evidence. Eighty-one studies assessed the effects of different strengths of fluoride toothpaste compared against each other (seven different strengths in 21 combinations) in permanent teeth of children and adolescents. There is high-certainty evidence that toothpaste containing 1000 to 1250 ppm fluoride is more effective than non-fluoride toothpaste. In permanent teeth of adults of all ages, 1000 or 1100 ppm toothpaste reduced decay compared with non-fluoride toothpaste. There is moderate-certainty evidence for the other findings reported in 'Main results' above. For other toothpaste strengths compared against each other or against non-fluoride toothpaste, there are too few studies with too few participants to have any clarity about the effects. Most studies did not measure harmful effects of toothpaste use, but when reported, effects such as soft tissue damage and tooth staining were minimal. There are benefits of using fluoride toothpaste at certain strengths to prevent tooth decay when compared with non-fluoride toothpaste. For many of the comparisons of different strengths of toothpaste, the findings are uncertain and could be challenged by further research. The choice of fluoride toothpaste for young children should be balanced against the risk of fluorosis."
