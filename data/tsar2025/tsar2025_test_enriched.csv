Also, not only are people spending money they don't have, they're using it to buy things they don't need.

85-a2,"One of the most important modern functions of zoos is supporting international breeding programmes, particularly for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.","Zoos has an important role. They help animals that are endangered, which means very few in the world, by running breeding programmes. In the wild, rare animals often cannot find a mate to have babies. They can also be killed by hunters, lose their homes, and be eaten by other animals. In a good zoo, they can live safely and have babies. When the number of wild animals gets very small, they can become too similar in their genes. Breeding in zoos helps this.

These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.","It is society, not nature, that suggests girls should study arts and humanities while boys study maths and physics. Another problem is that young people do not often see positive female role models in science jobs. In cartoons and stories, the scientist, inventor, or astronaut is usually a man. There is also a negative idea that scientists are ""geeky,"" have poor social skills, or work alone, far from the real world. These are false stereotypes shown by the media, but they may stop girls from seeing themselves as scientists and make science seem unattractive. If girls saw more positive female working in science, it would give them more confidence and help them feel that they belong in those subjects.",135,119,6,6,0.8814814814814815,1.0,-16,0,0.512396694214876,11.348358208955222,10.29121848739496,-1.0571397215602616,53.47860696517415,56.60500700280113,3.126400037626979,0.6220472440944882,0.94090444

The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university.

I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company.
